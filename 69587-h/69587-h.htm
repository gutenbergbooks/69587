<div><h1 id='p_v'>FOREWORD</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>How much is fact and how much is fiction in
the narrative told here of the early struggles
against fearful odds in the lives of the Disciples?
And why could the life of each Disciple not be
given in direct historic record?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For readers to whom these questions present
themselves, answer can be given in few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most cursory reading of the Gospels and
Epistles makes self-evident that the writers were
very much more concerned with the message than
the messenger; and this was natural in an age
when zealous partisans were much more eager to
rally round political and religious leaders than to
demonstrate the truth of the message in better
living and good works and pure beliefs. It is as
if the early evangelists of the Faith were determined
to let the cause rest on its eternal truths
rather than on the merits or frailties of the human
medium through whom the truths were transmitted
to humanity. It is as if the records seem
to say—don’t judge the message by the frail
human vessel from whom you take it. Judge it
by its own effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the human events in the lives of all the
Disciples and Apostles—the former, the first followers
of the Living Visible Christ; the latter,
evangelists, who later became followers—very
little, almost nothing, is told. One finds some of
the early followers first with John, the Baptist,
on the Dead Sea at Jordan Ford; then with Christ
in Galilee, then after the Crucifixion, in Jerusalem,
in Antioch, in Babylonia, in Rome, in the
cities of the Roman Road in Asia Minor, in
Greece, in Thrace, in Macedonia. Connected
narrative of their movements, there is none except
a few chapters in the Acts on Paul’s travels from
Damascus to Rome; and even in this, there are
long gaps. Paul speaks of hopes to go to Spain.
Did he go? We do not know, for if he did, Luke
his historian, leaves no record of that trip. Peter
writes a letter from Babylonia. Was he in the
region of the Euphrates; or was he in Rome, writing
in cypher because of the perils to the Faith
from the time Rome set up Emperor Worship in
all the pagan temples? Again, we do not know;
for consecutive narrative from year to year, there
is none; so that any attempt to give a connected
life of the leaders of early Christianity would fall
down from sheer lack of data; but the facts,
which we possess authenticated beyond controversy
by contemporary sacred and profane
writers, and by recent and ancient archæological
and linguistic research covering from Egypt to
Ethiopia, from Ephesus to Mesopotamia—throw
so much light on the early struggles of the New
Faith that by taking what the modern scenario
writer would call—“the spot-lights” of their activities—we
can reconstruct the early lives of the
leaders of the purest Faith the world has ever
known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now how much is fact and how much is
fiction in these narratives? Very little of the
essential is fiction. The fiction is only the string
for the jewels of Truth. A semi-secular figure,
who is absolutely historic, has been chosen as the
actor. The actor’s experiences are taken from
real life and actual fact. The reaction of the
experiences on the actor’s personality may be
called imaginary; but they are such as similar
experiences would have been on you, or me to-day;
and each action is chosen to throw a flash
light on some era in the Disciples’ and Apostles’
lives, which is known and proved and authenticated
in history, archæology and the documents
now coming so richly to light, owing to better
mastery of ancient script. In this way, we can
get a picture of the heroes and heroines of the
early days, who kept the Faith for us. We can
get a picture of them as living, struggling, heroic,
dauntless men and women, and not the shadowy
figures of half myth, half fairy stories, with which
we have too often enveloped the keepers of the
ark of the covenant of the Faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have referred to youth seeking light, where
many of the old school accuse them of thoughtlessly
seeking only pleasure. I consider this a
libel on modern youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in the hope of showing the verity of the
heroic lives in the early days of the Faith, that I
have planned these records. It is in the hope of
showing the keeping of that Faith as the supremely
best vocation for youth that I have tried
to dig out the unknown, historic facts bringing us
the Faith and clothe them in flesh and blood. If
the stories send back with fresh eyes readers to
the old records, their aim is fulfilled, and all the
errors, I pre-claim as my own. The truths, themselves,
are eternally old as they are eternally
young.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='p_1'>CHAPTER I<br/> <br/> NEITHER BOND NOR FREE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean soldier of the Prætorian
Guard sat on the stone bench in front of
his prisoner’s hut on the canal road to
Rome and listened to the drunken songs coming
from the bargemen at the place called the Three
Taverns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fair evening in spring. Frogs piped
from the marshes. Oleander and apricot bloom
drugged the night with dreams. The sun hung
over the far sea in a warrior shield, and the dust
from the chariot wheels filtered the air with powdered
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spring Festival was over. The corn ships
from Egypt had come in to Naples on time for
the free gifts to peasant and slave. All Rome
seemed out in holiday attire, on foot, on barge,
on horseback, or in chariot, either going home to
the hill towns, or down to the villas by the sea.
The plodding peasants and slaves had their little
bags of free corn and goatskins of wine flung
over their shoulders, and were followed by their
wives and their children as they turned off up to
the hills, where their bonfires were already aglow
with flamy eyes in the blue shadows of the mountains,
for all-night revels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the canal and its paved road passed an endless
procession of the great and the rich. Litters,
palanquins, chairs, with black Nubian slaves between
the poles, went surging past with the
patter of the runners’ bare feet on the pavement
and the glimpse of painted face or jeweled, pointed
hand, when the breeze blew the silk curtains from
the latticed windows. Barges, with black-faced
slaves chained to the iron rowlocks and gayly clad
men and women lolling on the ivory benches beneath
awnings and pennants of white, red and
gold, went gliding down the canal with a drip of
water from the oars colored in the dusty air like
a rainbow. Then there would be the sharp ring
of iron-shod hoofs over the cobblestones—a centurion
with his hundred horsemen riding in
rhythm as one man, their three-edged lances
aslant, would gallop seaward, followed by the
whirl of gold-rimmed chariot wheels, when some
general or senator went flashing past to take his
pastime for the night down in his grand villa by
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean soldier of the Prætorian
Guard glanced in the hut to see that all was well
with the prisoner inside, glanced toward the
Three Taverns, whence came louder songs and
wilder revels, loosened his metal headpiece, laid
the helmet on the stone bench beside him, and,
with another glance up and down the thronged
road, raised a bronze tankard of wine and
drained it to the lees. Smacking his lips, he set
it down and began eating some bread and cheese,
when the revels in the Three Taverns rose to the
tumult of a noisy brawl. A figure darted out of
the dense road crowds, running like a deer, pursued
by a rabble of drunken bargemen armed with
pikes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fugitive dashed along the stone parapet
of the canal, looking wildly to right and left, frantic
for a way of escape. Then the figure dived
into the thronged road, as if the crowd would
afford best hiding, in and out among the plodding
peasants, who scattered from the road in panic,
with the bargemen in full cry behind shouting,
“Stop him!—stop him!—slave!—slave!—runaway
slave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean guard had sprung up with
sword in his right hand for a slash at the flying
figure, when a great hue and cry rent the confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make way—make way—the Emperor!” and
a centurion band galloped through the dust, clearing
the road with their long lances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a flash of gold-rimmed chariot
wheels with flying horses in a blur. There was
the figure of a youthful man with a bare head and
shaved face, holding the reins far out as
charioteers drive; and Nero’s royal equipage had
passed in a smoke of dust with a great shout
from the barge travelers, who clapped their hands
and rose and waved their flags. The fleeing
figure, the pursuing bargemen, and the drunken
rabble had melted; and a little form crumpled up
in the doorway of the prison hut, panting as if
its lungs would burst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Prætorian guard stood motionless,
sword in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuing rabble had disappeared back to
the drunken revels in the Three Taverns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean drove his sword back in its
scabbard with a clank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he surveyed the figure lying prone at
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thin voice called softly from the dark of the
prison hut: “Who is there, my Julius? My eyes
grow poor. I cannot see in this light. I thought
I heard some one running in distress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—nothing—Master! ’Twas only that
madman Emperor of ours passed in his mad race
with his proselyte Jewess Queen. You heard
only the knaves of the Three Taverns noisy in
their cups.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crumpled figure had not looked up, but lay
panting on its face. A green-and-white turban,
such as mountaineers wear, had fallen off. The
hair was gold as the golden light of the sunset
and hung in unshorn curls about the neck. There
were the sky-blue jacket of the Asiatic Greeks, the
scarlet trousers and pointed red soft kid sandals
of a page; but the garments were torn as if
snatched by the pack of human wolves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burly Idumean guard smiled till his teeth
shone like ivory tusks through his grizzled beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No runaway this, but some grandam’s lackey,”
he smiled. “Is it boy or girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched the prone, panting figure with
his boot. The form did not rise. It crouched
upon its knees, and, with face hidden in hands,
bowed the head at the soldier’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An evil-faced old woman with bleared eyes and
wiry, disarranged gray hair came swaying drunkenly
up from the Three Taverns and paused,
peering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off out of this, harpy, snake of the dirt—sniff
earth!” the soldier clanked his scabbard
against the metal of his leg greaves, “back to your
wine-shop den. I’ll question you later of this!
We’ll have none of you here—” and the leering
woman vanished in the gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldier sat down on his stone bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up—boy or girl, whichever you are—help
me unbuckle my breastplate and greaves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure sprang up with the nimbleness of
youth. The eyes were blue with the terror of
a frightened girl, the cheeks were burned with the
tan of a hillside grape, and the lips were fine and
full as the caressed lips of a child. The long,
slim hands had slid off the metal breastplate of
the Prætorian, and were unbuckling the greaves
of an outstretched leg, when the soldier’s great
hand closed on the slim wrist and twisted the
palm upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No slave you! No callus here! No gyve
marks on the wrists! You’ve never worked
among the galley slaves—my little runaway!
Thighs too thin and shoulders too slim for these
foreign swine we bring to Rome in droves. Where
do you come from, young one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the mountains of Lebanon, my Lord
Julius,” answered the downcast face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Idumean gave a start. “How know you
the Romans call me Julius?” he sharply asked.
“I’m an Idumean of Herod the Great’s Guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you were commander on the Alexandrian
corn ship that carried all the Jewish prisoners
wrecked at Malta,” answered a trembling
voice in the falsetto between youth and man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were not among the prisoners, young one—nor
sailors either! I recall them—to a man.
I’ll test your truth. Mind your tongue! Describe
the ship, the passengers, the prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took ship at Fair Havens, Crete. I came
down from Phrygia. You remember the Prophet,
who was a prisoner from Cæsarea, wanted you
to tarry there for the winter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jupiter, I do; and now I wish I had, for
I’d be back in Idumea, leading our General Vespasian’s
cohorts if I hadn’t wrecked that accursed
corn ship, and not be cooling my heels here, waiting
the trial of these Jewish fanatics—what next?
Describe what next—the ship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ship had a golden goose at the stern. It
was full of Egyptian corn to the rowers’ benches.
She was deep as she was broad, and long as from
here to the Three Taverns—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on! You guess well and may lie better—all
corn ships are the same—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had flaming pennants and huge iron
anchors and two monstrous oars as paddles that
you used as rudders, and the pilot at the helm
was a bald-headed old man—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all are—these Greeks—from wearing
caps so tight. Any bargeman at the Taverns
could have told you that. Go on—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she had only one little boat astern, that
almost swamped in the mountain waves; and when
the northeaster struck her you were afraid of being
driven to Africa, and cut the great mainmast
and threw her overboard, and drifted for fourteen
days, four hundred miles; and when the hull
sprang a leak and strained to split apart you
frapped her round and round with great cables
and trussed her up as cooks tie up the legs of a
fowl! And when the soldiers would have sprung
into the little boat, you cut her adrift; and when
you would have slain the prisoners to prevent
escape, and slain yourself to avoid punishment for
the loss, it was the Prophet, who is the prisoner
in your hut there, stopped your hand and foretold
you not a soul would lose his life. Then you
cast the cargo overboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No stars, no sun we saw for fourteen days,
only the clouds and the pelting rain, and fogs
so thick a sword could cut them. When the
breakers and the surf roared ahead, you heaved
and heaved and heaved the lead, and knew we
were driving straight ashore to wreck in the
breakers, and you cast four great iron anchors
out astern to hold her back; but they only combed
the fine sand as a housekeeper’s knife cuts dough.
The shore of Malta Bay was soft as paste. The
pumps you set to work; but she settled on her
prow, like a swine’s snout in mud, with her goose-beaked
stern, high in the crash of waves, breaking
to splinters—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried the Idumean. “I’ll test your
truth right there! The bargemen of the Taverns
might have told you all the rest. When the ship
broke and the sailors and the prisoners plunged
over in the pelting dark to swim for it, what said
the Prophet, who is my prisoner, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you could not look the wind in the eye,
my Lord Julius, the Prophet bade you be of good
cheer and thanked his strange Judean God, whom
he called Christus, that he was reaching Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jupiter, child,” cried the guard, with a
crash of his sword on the stone bench, “you have
spoken truth! What next? Be careful how you
answer—your life hangs on it if you are slave!
It is death to harbor a runaway in Roman law—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not what next, my Lord Julius; for
Publius, the Governor of Malta, took all your
shipwrecked crew in, and you tarried to come by
the <span class='it'>Castor and Pollux</span> on to Neapolis (Naples)
while I took secret passage on a fishing vessel and
reached Rome first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Idumean then knew the youth spoke truth;
but not all the truth—what more? Here was a
lad of noble birth and clad in a page’s garments,
caught and held and hounded by the harpies of the
wine shops amid the rascal loafers of the underworld—lost
in the gutters of Rome for two full
years. Whose son was he and why was he
here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old guard’s manner changed. Could he
find the boy’s parents there might be money in it—honest
money—not the kidnapper’s ransom for
which the knavish criminals of the Three Taverns
had tried to steal him; but the old soldier knew he
must proceed cautiously. No gain to frighten a
startled bird that had fallen in your hand; a gift
of gold from the gods. Good money from a good
father somewhere back in Grecian Asia could he
but win the lad’s trust and get his story true, and
save some royal youth from those sharp-taloned
hawks of the wine shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bade the little stranger sit down on the
bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wine in the tankard there I drained; but
here’s bread and cheese—eat! How does that
compare with the bread and cheese of your
Lebanon herds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lad ate ravenously. The guard went inside
the hut and brought out fresh wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cheese is not so white as our goat curds;
but the bread is like pearls after Rome’s slave
fare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean pricked up his ears. “Slave
fare!” Then the boy had been held by some one
in Rome. The guard’s caution redoubled, to
which he added courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spring frogs piped from the marshes.
Last snatches of bird notes came from the
oleander and acacia groves in front of the villas
on the far side of the canal. A cooling breeze
came down from the hills where the festive bonfires
now winked a flamy eye. Only a few barges
glided down the waters of the canal. The traffic
of the paved road had quieted to an occasional
soldier-tread echoing iron on the stones, or the
barefoot patter of a hurrying furtive slave, or the
loud laughter of lewd women, and louder disputes
of the bargemen in the lodging houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brought you here?” quietly asked the
guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see the sights of Rome—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll warrant you’ve seen enough of them.
Have you seen the gladiators?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their blood sickened me,” answered the lad.
“The narrow streets choked me. I could not
breathe their yellow air after our Lebanon sunshine.
These marshes send up a yellow stench;
and the lodging houses stank; and your freedmen
loafers are night demons! I’d give all Rome for
one night back in Daphne’s Gardens at Antioch,
or down by the sea at Cæsarea. Your iron-shod
hoofs keep me from sleep. I’d give all Nero’s
Empire to hear the padded tread of our camels
over the turfs where the caravans of Damascus
and Chaldea meet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Idumean pondered that. He must, then,
be the son of some Damascus or Grecian merchant
in Asia. Good money and plenty of it in those
iron chests!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you the ‘Camel Song’ of the sand rovers
of Arabia?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the starlight he saw tears spring to the long-lashed
blue eyes.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Sweet to mine ears are the sounds</p>
<p class='line'>Of thy tinkling bells, O my camel!</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“And, oh, how the singing sands made melody,
my Lord, when the hot winds drove them like
sheets of snow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, that they do,” returned the old Idumean,
“and I would I were where I could hear them sing
instead of cooling my heels in Rome waiting for
this crazy Prophet to get his head chopped!
Much good that will do!” The old man’s manner
warmed to desert memories of his native land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll befriend you. You can stay here. The
Prophet needs some one to care for him and cook
his meals. He’s growing old. His sight is fading
fast. I’ve grown tired of nightly sleeping
chained to the arm of a prisoner you could not
bribe to run away, while the Emperor takes his
pleasure and puts off the acquittal of a man
Agrippa wrote was innocent, all because his wife
plays the convert to Jerusalem Jews to get a
revenue for protecting them, and hates this new
sect of Jews that call themselves Christians. You
could not pay this prisoner to escape, though
fewer and fewer friends come to see him every
day. They know the Empress is their enemy and
may work Nero to some fresh madness any day.
If it were not I value my own head, I’d sometimes
believe him myself; but no head of mine for these
mad zealots! It takes the iron hand of a Herod
to beat out the flame of their sedition, and not
the gentle pleading of young Agrippa to bring
them to their senses! When the Prophet gets his
pardon, if he is wise he’ll haste to Spain and never
set foot in Rome or Jerusalem again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second draft of wine—for the mountain lad
had not touched the fresh tankard—had loosened
the old soldier’s tongue. “I mind when I served
Herod’s son as a lad like you at Cæsarea and won
my freedom in the great gladiatorial combat in
the theater, where the sands swam in blood to
the knees, with Agrippa the Great sitting clad in
his mail of silver, before the owl flew over and
brought him ill-omens so that he fell down
dead—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” interrupted the boy—“were you once
a slave, too, my Lord Julius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too,” noted the old Idumean. The softened
manner hardened. Was he a slave after all?
“What did the harpies of the wine shops want of
you? A lad clad in Damascus silks would not
touch these sows of Rome’s gutters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy answered eagerly. “They said the
Emperor would pass in his chariot to-night; and
the Empress Poppæa was to go down to the sea
in her ivory barge. They meant to strip me,
throw me in the water, rescue me, and offer me
for sale as her barge passed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old guard laughed so harshly that all his
ivory teeth gleamed ugly as a boar’s tusks. “And
I’ll warrant if ever she saw your milk-white mountain
skin stripped, they would have made the sale
at three times a slave’s price. There is more in
this—there is more in this. Why did you leave
your mountains of Lebanon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not,” hotly protested the baited boy,
becoming frightened at the changed manner of
the Idumean. “When Felix cleared the robbers
out of Galilee, I was held for ransom in their
caves. They said we mountaineers were robbers.
We never were. We are shepherds; but I was
caught in my father’s caravan. He was the great
sheik of the road from Damascus to the East; and
Felix gave me to young Agrippa for a toy, a plaything.
I was a page to the Princess Bernice when
your prisoner Prophet in there made his plea
before Agrippa the Young to come to Rome and
prove his case; but when the Princess Bernice was
sent to Cilicia to marry that old man there, and
still the evil tongues about her and her brother—”</p>

<img src='images/tree2.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The boy paused in confusion, blushing red as a
girl. The Idumean grasped his wrist. “Go on—the
truth—or I’ll have you torn limb from limb
by the tigers in the arena. What of that night
monster, Bernice, with the snaky Herod blood in
her veins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy cried out with the pain of the viselike
grasp. “The Princess bade me not to fear to
come to Rome, where she would come when
she had shaved her head and paid a vow in
Jerusalem—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where she is now, and all Rome laughing at
the pretext,” the old Idumean loosened his grasp.
“Where she is now, to slip her old husband and
throw her net over Titus, our General Vespasian’s
son. I’ll warrant it will be a net of air she’ll
weave; the spider maid will throw her wiles on
the next poor fly! Did the King Agrippa’s sister
send you to Rome? Have a care how you answer
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my Lord Julius, the King, her brother
Agrippa, handed me to a Grecian merchant in
Colossé; but with the gold his sister gave me I
ran away and took ship to Rome from Crete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious, terrible crafty change had come over
the guard. No wild boar of the desert was he
now, but crafty hunter stalking human prey in
Rome’s underworld. “Young one—I have no love
for these seditious Judeans; but I’ll befriend you
because I have given you a Roman’s pledge.
Here’s my right hand as pledge no Roman ever
broke. Had I lost my prisoners it would have cost
my head; but when you go into the Prophet there,
see you do not bleat like one of your long-eared
mountain goats! Blastus, Herod’s old chamberlain,
is friend of his; so is Manæn, Herod’s foster-brother,
and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod’s
steward! Keep yourself out of sight in the inner
room when strangers call; for some of Cæsar’s
household also come here, whether to spy or believe,
how do I know? But how did the knaves
and body snatchers of the Three Taverns snare
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was coming out to seek the young scribe
Timothy—I saw him once and helped him carry
the Prophet in, when he was mobbed and stoned
and left for dead in Lystra—I thought he’d help
me back to my people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Idumean rose impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That spider maid! The vixen with Herod’s
snaky blood! Go inside! I’ll lock the door!
Prepare the Prophet his supper. I’ll to the Three
Taverns to ferret this. Remember if you try to
run away—there is no escape from Roman power
in all the known world from Gaul to the Ganges;
but I see one rich way of escape to fortune for
you, and money for me to make me rich, if Bernice
ever cast her eyes at you—might save young Titus,
son of our General, falling a victim to her wiles!
Go in, I say, and keep your tongue from blabbing—or
I’ll cut it out with my dagger! Princess
Bernice! Titus’ mistress! By Jupiter, ’tis my
lucky day at last and I’ll make offerings to Fortune,”
he muttered, striding off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heart of the frightened boy almost stopped.
He seemed to have jumped from danger close to
death or torture. What had he told, or not
told, that made him, a friendless Grecian boy in
Imperial Rome, of great money value to the Idumean
guard the minute Bernice’s name was mentioned?
Why had the rough soldier called the
young princess a “night monster,” “a spider
maid,” “a vixen with snaky blood,” “a nymph”
aiming a net at Titus, the son of the Roman General
in Asia? Why should a girl princess not flee
one old husband, married to silence evil tongues,
and seek a younger mate in the General’s son?
Wise, wise as seer or prophet is the intuition of
youth; but stronger than the breastplate of Imperial
Rome the innocence of youth; for the boy
had not told all the truth. Something he held
back for the love of the royal mistress, who had
befriended him. He had not told the Idumean
captain that when he had been handed over to the
merchant of Colossé he had been sold by King
Agrippa because his young master was jealous
of his sister’s affections for a page; and when he
had taken ship at Crete, dressed as a page, he was
a runaway slave, with Princess Bernice’s gold in
a goatskin wallet round his girdle, obeying her
orders “to have no fear to go to Rome; she would
meet him there: to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his youthful heart it seemed no evil thing
that she should come to Rome and marry Titus,
Vespasian’s son, where he again could be her page.
He could not know that all Rome was now counting
on General Vespasian to save the Empire and
become Emperor. He would not have had long
to wait, as destiny soon rolled the years to Vespasian’s
triumphial entry into Rome—if the harpy
women of the wine shops on the water front had
not taken note of his beauty and set the bargemen
on to kidnap him as bait for higher game in Nero’s
Palace, where ruled an evil woman, guided only
by her own wicked desires.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The boy heard the door clank as the Prætorian
guard drew the chain across outside and snapped
the great twin locks with a key as long as a man’s
forearm. He heard the ring of the swift soldier
tread as the Idumean strode over the stones for
the Three Taverns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned. The room was dark but for a
flickering peat fire on the hearth and a little guttering
olive oil wick in a stone or breccia lamp on
a rough board table. The floor was softened with
sand and earth. The window was high and
latticed, but let a soft breeze in from the sea. A
little, stooped old man with a white beard and
snow white hair and skullcap such as doctors of
the law wore, sat on a backless stool at the table,
writing on a scroll which he unwound from a
roller as he wrote, with his eyes so close to the
papyrus that he did not see the boy’s form against
the dark of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for the table and the backless stool there
was no furniture in the prison hut but two couches,
close together near the door; and the boy noticed
that while the prisoner’s right hand wrote and
wrote on unheeding, his left arm, resting on the
table, had a huge handcuff attached to an iron
chain which also lay on the table; and this was the
Prophet, whom he had helped the scribe Timothy
carry in stoned for dead at Lystra. This was the
man, when the wreck broke up at Malta, who
stood in the pelting rain and the dark and bade
the Lord Julius “be of good cheer” and thanked
his strange God “that now at last he could publish
the Glad News at Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had not noticed the strange leader of
the strange new sect in the Judgment Hall at
Cæsarea, because he had been too young, the toy
and plaything of the youthful King Agrippa and
his younger sister, Bernice, and he had noticed
him still less at Lystra, some years before, because
he had been still younger and much too excited
over the mob. There is a discrepancy here in the
boy’s story as picked out of the old records; and
yet the discrepancy proves its truth, for he could
not have been more than four or five. Yet he
distinctly remembered coming in on one of his
father’s caravans for Damascus from the South,
and seeing the maddened mob, and running with
all the camel drivers toward the gates of the city,
where he had picked up the insensible Prophet’s
cap and helped the young scribe Timothy to
shuffle the almost lifeless form through the doors
into the house of Lois and Eunice, Timothy’s
people, who were Greek merchants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the ship wrecked between Crete and Malta,
he recalled the prisoner of two years ago well
enough; but he had kept himself out of sight from
both prisoners and sailors all he could on that
voyage, staying below deck on plea of seasickness
by day and coming up only in the wild nights,
when the high-rolling cape of his black cloak had
hidden his face; and he could dream his dreams
of awakening youth, and the message of hope his
Princess’s black glance had thrown him when
she slipped him the wallet of gold pieces from her
litter chair and bade him “haste to Rome and
wait there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it had been no easy business for him “to
haste to Rome,” for the merchant of Colossé to
whom Agrippa in a moment of jealous suspicion
had sold him had been an exacting master, and had
set the new young slave to keeping accounts in the
great warerooms. It had only been his knowledge
of the Phrygian patois dialect, half Assyrian, half
Greek, that had induced the merchant to send him
to the seacoast and the Isles of the Sea to collect
exchange on accounts. He had collected the accounts.
Then he had taken ship at Crete and run
away without a qualm. Why should he have
qualms? Had he not been kidnapped by the
robbers of Galilee and held for ransom, and,
when the robbers were routed out by Felix, given
as a slave—he, who came from the mountaineers
who never had been slaves—to young King
Agrippa and the sister, Bernice?</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, life had become a golden dream of
awakening youth. Though Bernice had been a wife
to one Herod, and now was sent north to be wife
to another old man, after the custom of the
Herods to strengthen their thrones by marrying
their daughters to powerful rulers, Bernice had
been almost as young as he—she was barely
twenty. He had been set at first to seeing that the
Nubian slaves kept the royal baths at Cæsarea
clean. Then in a fit of suspicion over having any
but black eunuchs, who were mutes, attend the
royal baths, Agrippa had sent him to keep the
tracks of the chariot races powdered with soft
sand to fill the wheel ruts and save the horses’
knees if a racer slipped on the swift course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There he had gained the first glimpse of the
Princess’s favor toward himself. She had been
driving with her royal young brother in one of
the trials for the chariot races. The snowy steeds
of the young King’s chariot were given precedence
of all others, the Festus’s wild Arab horses were
champing the bits to pass, and the Roman had
great ado to hold them behind Agrippa. A dozen
other prancing teams were surging behind. She
had worn a silver bangle round her brow to hold
back her hair. On her brow hung a jade-stone
ornament from Arabia with the swastika cross of
luck beaded in gold. In the wild charge of the
racers the jade pendant had bounced from its
setting in the sand. Leaping in front of the other
racers, the boy had rescued the emblem of good
luck from trampling; and all the people in the
seats of the great hippodrome had cheered his
pluck. Fortune had come to him in the little
jewel with the odd cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the charioteers came round the course
again, King Agrippa himself had stooped to receive
the restored jewel; and the people had
cheered again; and when Agrippa and Bernice
had gone up to Daphne’s Gardens at Antioch,
for the wild, lawless pleasures there, then had followed
another golden dream of awakening youth.
The boy did not know, when he had been with
the royal lovers in Daphne’s Gardens, that only a
few miles away was the Prophet, with the Christians
of Antioch; and here they were, both thrown
together in the evil snares of Rome.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Amid the
roses and the palms and the love temples and the
fountains of the gardens were artificial lakes,
where plied boats with silken awnings rowed by
Naiads in silver-and-golden nets to the music of
zither and harp under the Moon Goddess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the only point in the boy’s story where there is
any discrepancy between his experiences as told by himself
and the sacred and profane writers of the period. It
does not appear among the sacred writers whether the corn
ships carrying the Prophet at the various ports of call
delayed long enough for the prisoners to have gone in to
Antioch, as they did at all the other ports where Christians
dwelt; but in the profane writers of Rome and
Greece at the period ’61 A.D. to ’68 A.D., are abundant
proofs of all the youth’s adventures in Daphne’s Gardens;
and Bernice’s record became an infamy in Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Agrippa and Bernice took their pleasure,
and he, now the trusted page, accompanied them,
as steersman for the nymphs. He was clad in
silvered silks, the girl rowers in spangled nets,
with naked limbs the color of pink shells. He
knew that five hundred bastinadoes on the soles of
his feet would be the punishment if ever he
breathed a word of what he saw on these nights;
and he saw nothing; but dipped his steersman
paddle to the rhythm of the temple music, and
watched the limpid water ripple in drops of moonlit
gold, and dreamed his dreams of awakening
youth, which are wiser than seers in their intuitions
and stronger than breastplates of bronze in
their innocence. He knew nothing going on
around him because he saw nothing but Bernice’s
eyes; and she was so far beyond his reach, he saw
no spider net in those black, fathomless eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then one day crashed down his house of
dreams in catastrophe about his youth. It had
been a wild day of painted barges, of soothsayers,
of magicians, of story-tellers, of dwarfs, of
buffoons, of libations to Bacchus, and temple
nymphs clad in golden gauze. The flesh of grown
man did not live that could pass that day unscathed;
and the page, who had been a mountain
boy, knew naught of a goddess who could turn
men to swine. There had been an older man with
King Agrippa and his sister that day. The boy
remembered afterward the older man had the
face of one of the satyrs, half man, half goat, of
whom his mountain tribes told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been frenzied dancing in the love
temples and more libations to Bacchus; but the
mountaineers do not drink; and at the end of that
day, to quiet evil tongues, Princess Bernice had
been affianced to the King with the satyr face;
and the star of the boy’s lamp had gone out in
utter blackness, with his heart cold lead, till,
passing from the love temple in her curtained,
latticed litter, she had thrust out her hand to him
in the dark and given him the purse of gold and
bade him haste to Rome and meet her there,
while she went to Jerusalem to pay a vow! He
did not know the nature of that vow, though all
the fashion of Rome was laughing over it, and
poets made mock of it and actors in the theaters
extemporized lines on “Bernice’s locks” and do to
this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew with the knowledge of youth she had
shaved her head and taken her vow to escape her
elderly spouse; and now the rough Idumean guard
had said all Rome was laughing at the way the
sly maid had gone to Jerusalem but to throw her
nymph net over Titus, son of Vespasian, who
might become Emperor after Nero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he stood in the prison hut of Rome,
with the wolf harpies of the water-front wine
shops outside, locked in by the Roman soldier, who
knew there was fortune to be grasped by restoring
a slave, with the threat ringing in his ears—“There
is no escape from Roman power in all the
known world; keep your tongue from blabbing—or
I’ll cut it out with my dagger,” and the Lebanon
boy had seen captives whose tongues had
been cut by daggers. He knew this was no idle
threat; but he did not know it was his boyish
beauty that had cast the fatal net of danger round
himself.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The boy stood with his head hanging, behind
the locked door of the prison hut, like a fly caught
in an evil spider web. He did not ascribe the net
flung round him by dark eyes seen through the
lattice of a palanquin to any spider maid; for he
was still thinking with the knowledge of youth
rather than age. He only knew the spider net
had become strong chains binding him to the evil
forces of the great Imperial City of the world,
and that he had been flung into that net by a destiny
uncontrolled by him except for the one act—when
he had run away from his merchant master
at Colossé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too deeply sunk in sudden despond and
fear to notice the flickering of the shadows from
the lifted breccia-stone lamp held in the Prophet’s
hand, while the other hand shaded the old man’s
defective vision peering at the ragged figure
against the back of the locked door. All hope had
flickered out for him with the turning of the
double lock by that great key the Idumean carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice spoke out of the dark, quiet, clear, and
limpid as his own mountain streams in Lebanon:
“Child, come here! Why are you troubled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy raised his long-lashed blue eyes and
looked across to see, not the little withered wisp
of a man he had remembered as the Prophet, but
a snow-white face illumined in an ethereal light
and framed in an aureole of snow white hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord Julius bade me prepare your
supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prophet did not press his question.
“There are the corn bread and the leben in the
alcove,” he said, pointing to a dark corner of the
stone wall, “and in one jar you will find the drinking
water and in the other the fresh pulse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy laid the meal on the rough table without
a word and took his stand behind the
Prophet’s stool. He was still dust spattered and
torn from his fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the couch to the table,” requested the
Prophet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking the Master wished to eat reclining,
after the manner of the Judeans, the boy lifted
the couch and placed it at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Join me,” gently urged the Prophet. “I remember
when I was a lad in Tarsus before I went
down to study law in Jerusalem, we used to say
of the mountain men, when they had broken bread
and salt with us, they would be our friends forever,
and never utter word, or think thought
against host or guest. A good rule, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears sprang to the lad’s eyes; for what the
Prophet had said was true, and recalled all the
stern tradition of the mountain tribes, who dwelt
in tents and roved the desert on camels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us bless God and give thanks,” said the
Master, bowing his head; and the boy understood
neither the strange Deity to whom thanks were
given nor what there was for thanks in a prison
hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must have been the white hair or the white
beard; for though the wick was guttering lower in
the breccia lamp, that luminous look seemed to
shine brighter and brighter round the figure of
the Prophet. The boy could see his hands like
hands of snow in the gathering dusk of the hut;
and his brow shone with the radiance of the sun’s
white flame at dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you wish to see Timothy?” he asked,
as though reading the lad’s thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereat, the youth’s pent emotions of terror
and despondency and fearful unknown danger
broke in floods of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, oh, Master,” cried the boy, finishing the
narrative that the Idumean had forbidden him to
tell, and holding back nothing but his love for the
Princess, “my Lord Julius says there is no escape
from the power of Rome from Gaul to the Ganges
for a slave. Let me be your slave, oh, Master!
Master, buy me and save me! I’ll serve you as
never Emperor was served in thought and speech
and act! I’ll serve you forever with no brand on
my palms or shoulders.” And the little mountaineer,
who never yet had bowed his head to
earth as slave, fell at the old man’s knees sobbing,
and would have placed the Prophet’s foot on his
neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was your merchant master’s name in
Colossé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord Philemon; and oh, my Master, I’ll
pay him back my price and all the money I stole
to run away to Rome. I’ll work my hands to the
bone! I’ll earn wages for my price by acting as
runner between the poles for the great Romans in
the villas here. I’ll pay him back fourfold as the
law demands. Only let me stay—keep me from
the wolves of Rome—keep the Lord Julius from
selling me to Nero’s Palace, or tearing out my
tongue for telling you, or flogging me five hundred
bastinadoes on my feet for running away, or
betraying me for telling of Bernice’s kindness. I
know now what I should or should not tell, nor
why—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, those crafty foxes of the Herod brood!
’Twas what Christ called them when they slew
John for Salome’s dance. She was of the same
brood of vipers long ago; and the blood of a
Herod runs true to color.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prophet’s hands were over his eyes and he
seemed to be thinking back long, long years. The
hearth fire guttered lower. The lamp wick had
burned almost to the edge of the oil, and still the
Prophet’s face shone with luminous radiance as of
an inner white flame; and his hands looked like
ethereal hands through which flamed an inner fire
of the spirit in kindly deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Master, let me be your slave—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, there are nor bond nor free in the Great
Kingdom which I serve; for neither life nor
death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor
heights, nor depths, nor any other creature shall
be able to separate us from the love of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor bond nor free?” cried the little mountaineer.
“Is there a kingdom in all the world
where there are neither bond nor free?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Kingdom is here and now,” said the
Prophet; and his brow shone with the radiance
of moonlight on the snowy peaks of Lebanon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir,” cried the boy, “they held me slave,
and they hold you in bonds; for the King Agrippa
told the Lord Julius—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two bodies there are,” answered the Prophet
gently, “one terrestrial and one celestial—one
that waxes old as a garment which we cast aside,
and one that grows younger with fuller life as
the years nearer draw to God; and neither life
nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor any other creature than ourselves can place
bonds upon that body. Like the air, which we
do not see, but in which we live and move and
have our being, that celestial body lives and moves
and has its being in the love of God. Child,
rejoice, rejoice, again I say rejoice, that the Glad
News has come and the Kingdom is here—and
now.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When the Idumean returned, his mood seemed
again gentler. He bade the boy fasten the wrist
gyves of the chain on the prisoner’s left arm to
his own right wrist, and to sleep on the floor,
so that he as older man would not be troubled in
his sleep by the clank of the chain when he tossed
restlessly at night, as age is wont to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the boy wakened in the morning
with the day-star shining through the lattice of
the high window, he found his new Master had
thrown over him, against the dank chill of the
marshes at night, his own black gabardine doctor’s
cloak of Damascus velvet. While the Idumean
and the prisoner, chained up again at sunrise,
took the air in parade before the barracks
of the Prætorian Guard, the youth swept out the
hut floor with a broom of brush and laid the
breakfast on the rough board table. Then the
bonds were unlocked from the guard’s arms and
the prisoner sat down to write letters, or receive
visitors, and the old Idumean again posted
himself on the stone bench in front of the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the lad came out, the Idumean bade
him sit down on the bench to talk. “The prisoner
says he has arranged to take you for—by
Jupiter—he wouldn’t call you ‘slave’—a queer
lot these followers of Christus—he said he’d take
you for his helper—he’d known your merchant
master as a friend in Colossé and would take you
for a pledge of what that merchant owed him.
That’s good Roman law. You’re safe enough
now. He said your new name must be Onesimus—the
Helpful One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that—is my very own name. How could
he know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prætorian guard smiled. “He knows queer
things in queer ways, this prisoner. Rome is
full of magicians and sorcerers and soothsayers,
mostly Greeks and Jews; but I never knew one
could tell what he foretold about the storm, nor
hold from mutiny two hundred and seventy prisoners
swimming for freedom unchained in the
open sea. What puzzles me is, when he has this
power, why doesn’t he use it to get himself his
freedom instead of wasting two full years here
babbling of the Glad News—Glad News—Glad
News? News, indeed, ’twill be if Nero places
all his tribe in the arena to feed the wild beasts!
Why doesn’t he use his power to build himself a
fortune, and buy a kingdom as Herod did, and
rule all Jewry? Then I’ll follow him myself;
for Rome is breaking up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he say when you ask him that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, folly about a Kingdom not made with
hands; a Kingdom of the soul. What’s a soul
to Roman legions? Sometimes, like Festus, I
incline to think much learning hath made him
mad—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember the very words—the very words
he said at Cæsarea the day I saved the jewel on
the chariot course for Princess Bernice; and King
Agrippa said ‘Almost thou persuadest me to be
a Christian’—you know the way King Agrippa
has, pretending to agree, to draw the adversary
on—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what said our Prophet to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He smiled that gentle, fearless way of his and
said—‘I would thou wert such as I am’; and all
his prison chains rattled to the floor as he threw
up his arm when he said that; and the great ones
on the judgment seat broke out in laughter. King
Agrippa laughed the merriest of all; and the
Princess whispered ‘The gods forbid.’ What does
he teach? What does he believe, Lord Julius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I know?” answered the Idumean
roughly. “It’s always Glad News—Glad News—Glad
News; Rejoice—Rejoice—Rejoice! By
Jupiter, what have the Jews had to rejoice about
for a thousand years, till Rome came and gave
them good roads and theaters and forums and
aqueducts, and held the fierce sand rovers back,
plundering their very Holy Temple with its
golden doors? I mind once hearing the soldiers
talk of an Egyptian, I think it was, who plundered
their precious Temple before Herod rebuilt it;
and when he entered into their Holy of Holies,
where never man trod, and their own priests
opened only once a year to take the gold angels
above the Altar, there wasn’t even the image of
a little gold god—not a thing in brass or silver
like a god—only a queer blue cloud like a flame
from some of their magic fires—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A queer blue cloud like a flame?” repeated
the boy. “Why, that’s the way his face and hands
look in the dark. What does he teach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen when his visitors come, and you’ll learn
soon enough if you can make anything of their
Greek doctrine and Jewish jargon—I can’t. I’m
Idumean—Roman—I believe in pikes and swords—in
law and gold. One day it’s ‘don’t be insipid’—‘don’t
lose your salt’—‘never assume
gloomy looks’—‘don’t throw pearls to swine’—‘away
with fear’—‘laugh at the sting of death’—‘lead
justice to victory’; or else he tells these
Jews of Rome they are ‘fatheads and dullwits
and grosshearts,’ with which we Romans agree;
or else ‘the earth is an inn and death the eternal
house to which he has the key to another house
of many mansions,’ or he quotes that old Job
legend of the Arabs, about ‘flesh renewed as a
little child’s’; but you should hear him when the
young Timothy comes— ‘It’s Timothy, son, beware
the young widows.’ That’s what I call
sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be good advice to you next time a
princess with black eyes casts her net at a simpleton!
He calls his Christus a Lamb of sacrifice
for sin. That’s queer; for I remember nearly
forty years ago, when I was your age, I helped
to crucify that Christus. Still it’s not so different
from the Sacred Bull of Egypt by which
the priests get revenue, or the Sacred Lion of
Chaldea, or Jupiter of our Sun Temples. Our
kings all get revenue by some religious trick
hitched up to fear of some god—sun or star or
love of war! As I tell you, I’m a plain soldier.
I can make nothing of it. I’m for the power
of Rome, the law of Rome, the wealth of Rome;
there is no power on earth can stand up against
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy sat pondering. He couldn’t forget
that little blue flame above the desecrated Altar of
the plundered Temple, like the radiance of the
Prophet’s brow in the dark. Perhaps all eyes
could not see that flame. Perhaps that was what
had blinded the Prophet. He’d ask him about
that.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And so the summer ran to winter and the winter
to spring again, when the emptied corn ships
went back to Greece and Egypt, laden with tin
from Britain and hides from Gaul and copper
from Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy saw and pondered much. He was
known now among the Jews of Rome as the
adopted son of the prisoner. What passed between
the boy and the Prophet, only God knows.
They were as loving father and more loving
son. The Prophet was restless when the boy was
out of his sight; and the boy’s eyes followed his
master with the mute love of a child for a saint.
But fewer and fewer converts came to see the
Prophet; for Nero’s mood was darkening toward
the new sect; and the believers were scattering
to the hills and to the Isles of the Sea before the
storm broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the gentle Greek physician called Luke
kept coming; and one Mark, a deacon, who talked
much of a great leader, Peter; and the young
scribe, Timothy, grown more ethereal and frail
as he added years, and a great one, called Epaphroditus,
who was friend of many great ones, but
led no sect for fear of his head. Once Epaphroditus
came with a learned Jewish scholar called
Josephus, whose records may be read to this
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he and the Prophet talked long and bitterly
of the law, of the Roman rulers and armies
in Judea. Like Epaphroditus, Josephus openly
joined no sect that was cold or indifferent to
Rome; but his beliefs may be read between the
lines of all he wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And once there came with Epaphroditus a
strange huge man clad all in white from Alexandria,
followed by a caravan of camels that
Roman rumor said had traversed all the world.
His name was Apollos; and he joined the learning
of the Persians to the learning of the Greeks;
and had prophesied all that the prisoner told;
and his sayings, too, may be found to this day
both among the Egyptians and the Persians. The
Prophet and the huge man in white embraced
like brothers; and all Rome went mad with the
sensations of a day over what they called the
Magian. Rome was more mad over his caravan
of camels than about his doctrines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the boy turned to his beloved patron:
“Master,” he said, “when you have power to
save me, why do you not use your power to save
yourself and flee from the dangers of Rome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he that saveth his life shall lose it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that night, when he was writing a letter
to Timothy, who was in Greece, to come to Rome,
the boy heard the Prophet dictate the words, “I
have fought a good fight—I have finished my
course. I have kept the faith.” Why, the boy
wondered, does he say he has finished his course?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Timothy came to Rome, the boy went
in to his patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, the frogs were piping in the marshes.
It was a fair evening in spring. Again, the oleander
and the acacia and the almond and the
apricot bloom drugged the night with dreams.
Again, the sun hung over the far sea in a warrior
shield, and the dust from the chariot wheels
filtered the air with powdered gold. Again the
Spring Festival was over and all Rome seemed
out-of-doors, afoot, on barge, on horseback, or
in chariot, either going home to the hill towns
of the poor, or down to the rich villas by the
sea. Again, the bonfires burned on the hillsides
with flamy eye, and gold-wheeled chariots flashed
over the canal road in a smoke of dust. Again,
the bargemen and sailors and slave rowers up
from the corn ships of Egypt on Naples Bay made
the night ring with knavish revels in the water-front
wine shops; but though the sun sank as
golden on the waters and the stars came out as
silver over the hills, the canal was no longer the
happy thoroughfare of gay throngs in spring under
colored silk awnings with Nubian slaves on
the rowers’ ivory benches; for a mute fear was
settling over Rome as to what madness Nero
would next pursue; and the great senators and
generals no longer thronged to Rome. They had
moved their families to their hillside estates and
villas by the sea. The army and the loafers
and the idle freedmen and the slaves openly ruled
Rome. Nero could hold the loafers and the idle
freedmen and the slaves with gifts of free corn
and wild Bacchanalian festivals and gladiatorial
combats and the baiting of captives taken in war
by wild beasts, but all Rome was asking who
was strong enough to rule the vast Imperial
Army. What would Vespasian, busy in the wars
of Palestine, do when he came? What would
Titus, over whom Bernice was casting her spider
net, do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pall rested over the gayly colored spring
scenes of Rome. It was as if Vesuvius rumbled
and darkened long before the lava-flow buried
the beautiful villas in lakes of rock and fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when Onesimus, the helper, had asked the
prisoner Prophet why he did not save himself by
escaping from Rome, and had pondered that answer
about those who save life losing life, and
those losing life saving it, he came back in this
spring evening and stood timidly before the
Prophet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My beloved Master, now that you have Timothy
with you to write your letters and the physician
Luke to care for our body, would you miss
me if I went back to Colossé?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would miss you as I would a beloved son
begotten of mine own flesh,” said the prisoner
gently. “Have you not cast out fear of all that
man can do unto you? Why do you wish to go
to Colossé instead of carrying the glad tidings
to your mountain people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Master,” Onesimus had fallen to his knees,
with his face in the Prophet’s hands, which he
bathed in tears. “I fear not what all Rome
can do unto me; for I have joined that Kingdom
not made with hands; but I fear only the
reproach of a good conscience and of my Lord
of the Glad Kingdom. I have saved enough of
my earnings to pay back the merchant Philemon
fourfold the money I stole from him.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> He
bought me from King Agrippa for a price. I
would go back, his slave, till your King gives me
my freedom.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Prophet’s hands lifted and rested on the
boy’s hair. In the dark they shone with the luminous
light of the stars on snow. His lips were
moving—the boy heard him whisper— “The
Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the Lord make
his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee,
and give thee peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening the Idumean of the Prætorian
guards remained down at the water front among
the wine shops, and the Prophet wrote far into
the night. Onesimus would have written for him,
for the prisoner’s eyes had grown dimmer; but
the Master said it was better this letter should
be written privately; and he wrote it on a wax
tablet with an onyx stylus to guide his failing
sight. When he had finished he put the tablet
in a parchment case sealed with wax and bade
the boy give it to the merchant Philemon of
Colossé. Then he embraced Onesimus and sent
him to board the barges that would go down
the canal to the corn ships setting sail at daybreak
for Grecian Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here briefly is what he wrote. You will find
it exactly and fully as he wrote it in the oldest
record of documentary history in the world—the
most widely circulated documents in the modern
world and probably the least thoroughly read
of all books in the world. Space permits only the
briefest outline of the letter, the original of which
any reader can compare in any language known
in the world. Some few phrases differ according
to the language, but the purport is the same in
all; and the story is meticulously true in every
essential, though scholars and schools still quarrel
over some dates and two or three names. As far
as it is possible to figure these early dates, this
letter was written between 62 and 64 A.D.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Philemon, our beloved and fellow
worker, and to Apphia, our gracious lady .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I had great joy and comfort in your love, because
the hearts of God’s people have been and
are, refreshed through you, my brother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Therefore, though I speak very freely, it is for
love’s sake I rather beg of you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I, the aged
and prisoner .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. write to entreat you on behalf
of a child, whose father I have become in
my chains .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean Onesimus, who was a bad
bargain to you, but now, true to his name, has
become a helpful one to us both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sending him back to you in his person,
and it is as if I sent my own very heart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I wished to keep him with me that he might
minister to me in my old age and chains, but
without your consent I would not; for I wanted
it of your free will. Receive him back no longer
as a slave, but as brother, dear to me, beloved,
as a fellow worker for Christ. If you still regard
me as comrade, receive him as myself.
If he was ever dishonest, or is in your debt, charge
me with the amount. Hold me responsible for
the debt on your books. I pledge my signature.
I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact
you owe me yourself the same amount.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, beloved, do me this favor for our Lord’s
sake. Refresh my joy in Christ. I write you in
full confidence. I know you will do more than
I say, and provide accommodation for me; for
I hope through your prayers I shall be free to
come. Greetings from my fellow prisoners,
among whom are Mark and Luke. May the
graciousness of Christ be in the innermost soul
of every one of you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though they put the signatures to the letters
first in those days, which was a better thing
than our custom of having to read through a
letter to know who wrote it, the name signed to
that letter by a half-blind little old man, ill, and
so near death (Nero’s blade was already whetted
for the sacrifice), with a chain on his arm in a
prison hut, was</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“PAUL.”</p>

<div><h1 id='p_45'>CHAPTER II<br/> <br/> ARDATH, THE FIELD OF FLOWERS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Three women sat cooped in the great
fortress of Machærus, east of the Dead
Sea, peeved that a war for world power
had interfered with their own personal plans and
petty intrigues. The rose-tinted mountains of
Moab rose far to the east, tier on tier above
the Desert, dyed in a mystic fire of cloud and
light that might have been the abode of gods
from eternity. North and south, you could have
dropped a pebble from the turret, where the
women sat, down precipice sheer as a wall twenty-five
hundred feet. West, the clouds boiled a silver
sea far below the Fort bastion on the blue
and green of deep translucent waters. These
waters are to-day known as the Dead Sea. At
that time, they were called the Asphaltis Sea
owing to the pungent burnt odor of petroleum
and sulphur, that came up from their hot springs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Safe as an eagle’s nest above the storm clouds
perched the Fort on the mountain height, where
rulers’ wives and daughters were housed from
stress of war and raid, but angry as an eagle’s
young were the strident voices of these pampered
favorites of harem and court, that the blood of
men flowing deep as the horses’ bridles over at
the siege of Jerusalem, should be keeping these
caged birds from the garden of joy in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elder women rose petulantly and stood at
the deep casement of the window in the open turret,
where the breeze came up from the silver
clouds lying below on the Sea. By the uncertain
feeling out of her hands for the stone wall,
it was apparent she was almost blind. Her hair
lay lustrous black on her brow, but here and
there a silver line showed she was past middle
age, and the slight film across the pupils of her
black eyes betrayed the cataract obscuring light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A curse on these seditious Judeans,” she protested,
tapping her sandaled foot impatiently on
the stone floor. “Rome gave them the best government
they have ever had—justice, safety,
forums, aqueducts, theaters, low taxes; and what
have they returned to Rome for protection from
enemies east and west? Rebellion for seventy
years! First Herod the Great slew some brats in
Bethlehem; and he must needs go mad with
jealousy and strangle his Jewess wife, and be
haunted ever after by her pale ghost in this accursed
Fort! Then because I chose to love the
Second Herod instead of his brother Philip, to
whom I was sold as child, I must be taunted as
a sinner of the streets by the little Hermit John;
and my Lord Herod must turn soft because he
loved the ragged madman’s ‘rough honest ways.’
Honest? I call it insolence and would have torn
his tongue out if I could! What right have
raving fanatics to pry open private lives? I got
him prisoned in the dungeon here for two full
years before I caught my Lord Herod in his cups
and settled the Hermit’s mad impudence with the
headman’s sword.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two other women, who were yet in the
flush of first youth, rose and joined the elder in
the open window of the turret. One was short,
with crafty laughing eyes and full voluptuous inviting
lips, and the air of insolence in her beauty
that could challenge life. The other was tall and
slender with eyes that dreamed, but what or how
they dreamed no soul outside her own deep
thoughts could know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Aunt,” pleaded the slenderer of the
two, throwing an arm tenderly around the blind
woman, “with your mad Hermit dead, why rage
and bruise yourself against the past?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little soft dreaming fool!” The blind woman
petulantly threw the girl’s arm from her waist.
“Have you forgotten when my Lord Herod’s first
wife—that discarded rag of treachery, who could
not hold the love I won—went back to her father,
the King of Arabia, and roused all the tribes to
attack us here, we lost? We lost, and I was
blamed, and my Lord was banished first to the
barbarians of the Danube and then to the savages
of Spain, to whom I must go unless you can snare
Titus, the Emperor’s son, over in the siege of
Jerusalem there. Only you can save the last of
Herod’s line—Bernice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger woman designated Bernice gazed
deep in the silver clouds boiling above the Dead
Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much chance I have to snare Titus shut up
here away from the warriors of Jerusalem; but
if we Herod women must be played as pawns to
win kingdoms, let us play pawn for the biggest
prize of all—Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elder woman had placed her elbows on
the casement of the window and sank her face
in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were not such a little fool of dreams,
Niece Bernice, you would never have left Jerusalem.
You would have stayed on in the Temple
Herod built, paying your vows, if you had to
cling to the Altar horns! You were wife of
Herod Third; and who did more for the Judeans?
Free feasts, free games, you remember Cæsarea;
and all because your Lord let the Jews stone
James, that zealot of the Nazarene, know you
what the populace says? They say their God,
whom no one has even seen, slew your husband
in his coat of silver mail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank their God for that,” absently answered
the girl Bernice. “Herod Third was too
old. You chose your Herod. I was sold to
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other younger woman with the insolent
inviting voluptuous lips laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you had fallen in love with the little
blue-eyed slave, Onesimus, whom Felix and
Festus rescued from the robber bands of Galilee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That slur sounds not well from you, Sister
Drusilla! You, yourself, married freed slave.
Have you forgotten Felix was freed slave?” asked
the slenderer of the sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drusilla of the voluptuous lips laughed. “No,
nor have I forgotten he is the only one of all
the Herod husbands who left his wife safe with
wealth in times of peril. He rose to be ruler under
Rome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And drove the Jews to insurrection by his
thefts and taxes to give you wealth,” interrupted
Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older woman whirled on them with the
fires of fury in her blind eyes. “Peace to your
sparrow chatter—fools—fools—fools! What
do you know of love, or constancy? You barter
love and time for gain as gamblers throw their
dice. My Lord Herod and I bartered all for
love—and lost—and love as ever! And he is
far among the savages of Spain and I am caged
here to wait the fortune of war at Jerusalem!
And time is short, and I grow old, and does
his love grow cold? You read his letter brought
by the post this day, how he longs to hold me
in his arms once more! Nightly, I have prayed
to Istarte and Venus and Astoreth for my love
to descend to him in far-off Spain down the beams
of the starlight, or moonlight, to hold him forever
to me true! Instead of answer to my
prayers—what? This accursed Fort haunted by
the spirits of the dead! ’Twas here the spirit
of Mariamne, whom Herod the Great strangled,
came haunting him till he went mad. ’Tis here
where we are shut up prisoners of the past, beating
our weak women hands ’gainst the fetters of
fate, the ghosts of our past come haunting us!
I tell you fools that in the dark I can dream
I am not blind, but when I pray for my Lord’s
love to come and wrap me in his arms, when it
is dark and I can forget I am blind—what comes?
What comes? What comes? I say! I could
be a lioness to fight for my cubs, as all the Herod
women ever are; but when I pray for forgetfulness,
what comes—I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Aunt Herodias,” gently expostulated
the younger Bernice. “These are not wise words.
Our weak hands only bruise when we batter
fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool—your course is not yet run—dreaming
of a blue-eyed slave, when you should be in Jerusalem
mending all our fortunes by marrying Titus,
the Emperor’s son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two drew back from the violence of the
elder woman standing in the open-windowed
turret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herodias will be maniac unless we send her
to her husband in Spain,” whispered the sister
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maniac,” repeated the blind woman in scorn.
“So you would be, if nightly when you prayed
for love there came rolling over the stone floor
the bloody head of that wild Hermit beheaded
in the cellar here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If I could tear these
scales from my eyes and prove it is not true;
but can a blind lioness fight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go to the garden—we only anger her.
She will rave to exhaustion till she gets some sleep,
and dreams she sees the head again,” murmured
Drusilla. “I could wish we were out of the
haunted fortress here. It is ill-fated! Do you
go to Jerusalem and get the Emperor’s permission
for us to leave for Rome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do that, Sister Drusilla, but do not
anger her by making light of her mad love for
Herod. No Herod woman dare grow afraid.
Our past is a black, back wall! Our future is
blacker if Jerusalem falls and Judea is ruled direct
from Rome. Our brother Agrippa will be
deposed. He is last of our line. Everything
hangs on winning Titus’ favor; and with the
road to Jericho blocked black by troops, it is
easier to say ‘go to Jerusalem’ than go! Unless
a caravan comes this way from the East
bound for the Sea, which I can join disguised,
how can we escape the Roman guard set to watch
the gates?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended the stone stairs of the turret
in thoughtful silence and emerged in the great
garden of the Fort. A broad walled parapet ran
round the edge of the sheer precipice on which
the Fort was perched above the cloudy Sea. Only
one side gave exit, or approach—a narrow causeway
to the east with drop straight as a wall on
either side, leading out to the rose-tinted mountains
of Moab, tier on tier above the Desert
dyed in a mystic fire of cloud and light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old Idumean guard sat in the shade under
the arched gate to the causeway. He took his
helmet off and yawned drearily. His beard had
grizzled gray and his thatch of close-cropped
curly hair had whitened with age. As the two
sisters approached walking along the wall of the
parapet and came under the shade of the arch,
he rose stiffly and saluted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are the roads to Jerusalem, old Julius?”
asked Drusilla, throwing her purple silk cloak
back over her shoulder so her bare arms shone
jeweled with bracelets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blocked, blocked, Good Ladies,” returned the
old Idumean wearily. “Dreary task this, your
Highness, guarding sibyls, who could bewitch all
Rome’s generals if they escaped down to Jerusalem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the hammering we hear below the
fog of clouds?” asked Bernice trying to penetrate
the import of his answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Camel bells of some caravan coming up the
causeway, or clanking of the forges down at
Jericho making war engines for the siege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there many refugees in the caves between
here and the Jordan, Julius?” pressed Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nazarenes are fleeing from Jerusalem to
the Desert of Moab like sheep harried by wolves;
and robber bands are everywhere. I’ll warrant
those poor sheep will be fleeced of their wool
before they reach the caves of their Secret Lodges.
Dangerous, Ladies, too dangerous for princesses
in royal robes to venture these roads when my
head’s pledged for their safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should a princess want to pass that way,
old Julius?” smiled Drusilla of the voluptuous
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Titus, the Emperor’s son, is at the
end of yon road.” He pointed down the precipice
path towards Jericho beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drusilla laughed again. Bernice strolled
through the arched gateway and gazed past the
rose-mist of light and clouds above the Desert
mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there ghosts in the dungeons beneath the
Fort, dear Julius?” pressed Drusilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None that I know but spears and swords to
protect the women here if Titus fail at Jerusalem,”
answered the old Idumean, stretching his
spear across the open gate of the arch to the
causeway across Princess Bernice’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Princesses turned and retraced their
steps along the parapet. The old Idumean sat
down on the bench again with an evil smile that
showed all his yellow teeth like boar’s tusks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Witches! Enchantresses to turn men to
swine! If I had my will, I’d throw them all
over the precipice into the Dead Sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Drusilla! We are really prisoners
at Rome’s orders, though they pretend they are
protecting us here,” said Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are prison walls to true love? Eat,
drink and be merry; for to-morrow we die,”
laughed Drusilla. “Why are they holding us
prisoners here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To grace Rome’s chariot wheels if they conquer
Jerusalem,” Bernice answered bitterly.
“And if I go to Rome, I go not with chained
hands behind the chariots. I ride with Titus in
the chariot under the conquerors’ arch—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I thank Jupiter,” insolently laughed
Drusilla, “that my slave husband Felix left
enough gold to bribe freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended the stone steps from the parapet
to the gardens. The rose-and-silver mist
still boiled above the green translucent depths
of the Dead Sea. It looked, so far below, a jewel
in jade. An odor of roses and oleander came
from the sloping gardens. Far below they could
see the flat tiled roofs of the village outside the
walls clinging to the precipice like birds’ nests;
and every roof was crowded with women and
children, to get the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate women. If I had been a man, I would
have been a warrior in the thick of it at Jerusalem
there,” said Drusilla. “Women are feeble
and helpless sheep. They either huddle in fright
and go mad over the past like Aunt Herodias
up in the turret there, or—are eaten by the
wolves. If I knew where Felix camps among the
barbarians, I’d throw my royal estate to the winds
and join him to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not. I’d rule the wolf,” said Bernice
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their purple silk cloaks brushed the snowy
petals of the cyclamens lining the garden paths.
Bernice stooped and picked a field daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of gold,” she said dreamily, “with
vesture of white silk round it, I’ll pluck your
petals and—wish.” She plucked the white petals
one by one, throwing them on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it say? Do you get your wish?”
asked Drusilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice’s fingers rested on the last slender white
petal. She plucked it and kissed it. “I get my
wish,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clank of an armed tread startled their
daydream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned. It was the old Idumean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies, a camel caravan has just now come
up the causeway from the East. ’Twas their bells
you heard! They ask permission to rest in our
khan during the heat of the day and go on to
Jerusalem by night across the Jordan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are they?” demanded the Princess Drusilla
imperiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was why I came to ask your permission,
Princess! They are of the new Christian band
that gave such trouble to all the Herods. One
is a great figure of a man dressed in white with
a flowing beard and train of servants bound for
the Isles of Greece. His name is Apollos. I
saw him in Rome, where he was held in honor,
before Nero took the head of the prophet, Paul!
The other is a young presbyter, whatever that
may be, blue eyes, gold hair, who I could swear
as slave served Paul in Rome. His name has
slipped my mind; but they came in great state
with the protection of Rome and ask lodgings
in the Sun Temple till the heat of day passes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Onesimus,” exclaimed Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, as I mind now, Lady, that was his very
name; but he has grown a powerful man, fair
as the angels of Gaul—but this Apollos as I
questioned him, seemed a follower of the mad
Hermit, John Baptist, ’gainst whose ghost the
Queen Herodias raves at night. If they did not
bear permission from Rome, I’d bid them pack
to save trouble; but—” the old Idumean scratched
his thatch of whitening hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drusilla laughed insolently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bid them take quarters in the Temple of the
Sun but avoid the Palace here! Excuse us! Explain
the Queen’s illness prevents our receiving
them with becoming honor! Send down the best
of provisions and bid them enjoy the full freedom
of garden and baths after their journey.
Begone—” she peremptorily clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drusilla turned with a cynical laugh to her
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get your wish, Sister! You can join their
caravan and go to Jerusalem and plead our case
with Titus; but this must be kept from Aunt
Herodias. If this Apollos be a follower of the
raving Hermit, John, whose bloody head she sees
every night in her dreams, she’ll be for a potion
of poison on him and ditch our plans deeper than
the moat beneath the walls. I’ll take care of
the older man in the flowing white, ’spite of his
beard, if you’ll beguile the young one with the
golden locks. Now to the Temple of the Sun
to make offerings to Istarte and Venus and Astoreth
and all the goddesses of love under the
Evening Star! Herodias cannot be moved while
this madness is on her; but we can escape. You
get your wish, Sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bernice had turned white as the cyclamen
of snow which brushed the royal purple of her
silk vesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she repeated. “I get my wish! A
curse upon it! Must Herod’s daughters always,
always be pawns in Rome’s royal game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matter, if we are winning pawns?”
smiled the other. “Cheer up, Sister! Throw
away regret! Cast off fear! We can escape.
Herodias has lived her life and won, and lost,
and sits like an old fool drooling over her loss;
but we are young yet! Let us eat, drink and be
merry; for to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said, yourself, but a moment ago, you
thanked Jupiter your slave husband Felix was the
only one who had left a Herod daughter safe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drusilla, like her aunt earlier in the afternoon,
whirled upon her sister. Laughter had left
only craft in the deep black eyes, and on the cruel
voluptuous lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool,” she said with a stab of scorn. “Do
you hesitate because Onesimus, your slave boy,
has come back grown to man? Will your lure
be weaker, or stronger, now that he is grown
with the strong wine of manhood in his veins?
If you, a Herod’s daughter, could hesitate now,
I’d stab you with my own hand the first time I
found you asleep. Go to Jerusalem! Win Titus!
He will be Emperor, too, in time. Onesimus
can meet you in Rome. Bend fate to your will!
Do not be bent and broken by any fate. We
go to the Temple gardens to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean went clanking back to the
gate under the arch, stiff-legged as legs are wont
to walk, that have been in armored greaves for
seventy years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A curse on this Herod brood,” he went, muttering.
“These women have thrown every Herod
from his throne. If I had my will, I’d weight
their feet with stones and throw them over the
precipice in the Dead Sea; and I’d see these
Nazarenes feed the lions as they fed the wild
beasts in Nero’s days. Disturbers! Disturbers!
Trouble makers! Pilate, a suicide stabbed by his
own dagger! Procla, his wife, whining about the
crucifixion and bad dreams! Herod First a madman.
Herod Two an exile with his wife raving
here over the Hermit’s bloody head! I’d like
to know didn’t she order his head off at one blow
in this very Fort! Herod Three falls dead in
the theater of Cæsarea and his jade of a girl wife
here up to fresh tricks on Titus! Pah! A nice
task for an old soldier keeping guard of such
harpies! I’d slash their lily-stem throats if I
had my way.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The sun went down behind the rose-tinted
mountains of Judea to the west. Their peaks
gleamed in blood and fire above the red and
golden sands. Bernice sat on an ivory bench in
the gardens above the silver clouds lying on the
Dead Sea below. In her hand was a bunch of
snowy cyclamens, which she idly plucked. Before
her stood the young presbyter, Onesimus,
clad like his master in flowing white, with black
sandal straps braided halfway to the knee, a
sword hanging by a gold cord from his neck, his
hair as gold as the cord but cut short to the neck
after the Greek fashion, his deep blue eyes gazing
at the Princess as he would read her soul. Onesimus
had grown to powerful manhood in these
seven years since he left Paul at Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat silent, thinking, but what she thought,
he could not follow. There was a fifing of insects
from the dry grasses, that bordered the
garden walks. As the sun set over the blue green
lake and the orange hills beyond, the clamor of
war from the cañon below dulled and fell like
the subsiding waves of an angry sea. She turned
her seal ring round and round, and drew it from
her finger as if to pass it to him. She pressed
it to her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will this be amulet to keep you from all
harm?” she mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young presbyter trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Unseen King will keep me from all harm,”
he answered; “and I dare not wear it till we are
united for His Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” she said, “the Evening Star—Isis.
The dewdrops are her tears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas the Star brought the Wise Men of
the East,” he answered, “and there shall be no
more tears in His Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An awful loneliness and an awful loveliness
seemed to envelop her fragile form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young presbyter drew towards her as if
to wrest her from her Dead Sea hopes and take
her to that Unseen Kingdom with violent hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been with the great Apollos,
these long long years, my Onesimus?” she dreamily
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Babylonia and Assyria aiding the greatest
apostle of all—Peter,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, who lied and denied his leader and cut
the High Priest’s servant’s ear off at the trial
long years ago, as I have heard the Queen
Herodias tell?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say rather, Princess, he who learned in sin
his own weakness, and whose great heart grew
tender for all who fall in slippery places. He
learned not to trust his own strength even in
love, but—God’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pondered that absently plucking the cyclamens;
and her hands were slender as the lily
stems. The silver clouds rolled from below and
the translucent water lay a painted sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does your Master Apollos teach? How
differs he from the others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll answer that as Paul answered years ago
in Rome, when Ephesus and Corinth wrote to
know whether they should follow Paul, or Apollos.
Paul followed the Nazarene. Apollos professed
John, the Baptist; and when the followers
would have wrangled one against another, and so
missed the news of the Glad Kingdom in strife,
Paul wrote back—’twas but a few years before
Nero slew him—Paul plants; Apollos waters;
God gives the increase!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak as a gardener.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, dear Princess— We are all gardeners,
gardeners in the field of flowers which the Persians
call ‘Ardath’—the Garden of God called
Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that. I can understand that better than
an Unknown Kingdom not made with hands!
That Garden kind of Kingdom would be Glad
News to me, Onesimus! I could wander through
that kind of Garden, forever, if I had hold of your
hand! Sit at my feet, dear playmate of the long
ago, and tell me of your Garden—no, sit by my
side, I would hold your hand now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew him down to the ivory bench beside
her. He flushed as deep as the rose-tinted mountains
in the setting sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tell me of your Garden called Paradise,
while I can feel your thoughts flowing into mine
through the palm of your hand. This is Paradise
enough for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your hand, dear Princess, throbs too hard
for the peace of that Garden. It is a Garden
where there is eternal light, nor suffering, nor
care, nor sorrow, nor dark, nor sleep to miss one
hour of joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, too, I like,” she said. “Let us not
miss this hour of joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is watered by the Rivers of Eternal Life.
God’s thoughts are the seeds. They bloom in
human flowers. ’Tis ours to keep those human
flowers from running into poisonous weeds. The
flowers of this your earthly garden are fixed by
roots, where they are planted, but the human
thought seeds have power of choice like wings
to bear them where they will to go; and I would
that you would will to join our Unseen Garden,
not made with hands but thoughts—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew his hand between her breasts and
drank his eager gaze like one athirst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See yonder above the Sea is Istarte, the Evening
Star of love, Onesimus! Will love dwell
in our garden there as it shone in the Garden
of Daphne long ago, when first I read your dear
blue eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The God of Love is the Sun of that Garden,
Princess,” he answered, gently loosening her
passionate grasp and placing in her emptied palm
the cyclamens she had let fall. “You bade me
tell you of that Garden and Apollos’ teaching.
You know how the caves and grottos of the Jordan
from the Dead Sea to Damascus are filled
with the Nazarenes, who have fled from the
siege of Jerusalem, which our Lord foretold. In
all the cities of Decapolis, Apollos preached in
the Temples of the Sun. You know these cities
of the Greeks love and worship the Sun; but
it was the Son of God, Apollos preached, which
John the Hermit foretold; and so when the
priests had sung the psalms, Apollos would sound
out in his great thunder voice like a silver trumpet:
‘Lift up your heads, oh, ye gates, and let the
King of Glory in! Who is this King of Glory?
The Lord of angel hosts, He is your King of
Glory’; and when the multitude had settled to
listen, he would tell them of Ardath, the Garden
of God in Paradise, where God’s thoughts are
seeds and bloom in human flowers. Once, I mind,
when a woman came weeping whose child had been
slain in the siege as she escaped, after she heard
Apollos she left the Temple rejoicing because
her child had become a flower of light in the
Garden of God; and a lover, whose bride had
been slain, went out, weeping no more, because
his bride was not dead, but waiting him in the
Garden of God; and a soldier mad with remorse
that his cruelty had killed his wife left all calmed
because he had faith she, too, had gone to the
Garden and had sent him Apollos to teach the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice plucked the snowy cyclamens again
from their stems. Her slim hand trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show me the way, Onesimus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was so low he had to bend across
her slender figure to catch the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no other way but to repent, be baptized,
leave off sin and follow the Light of the
Eternal Son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So absorbed were the lovers they did not see
the tall white figure of the great teacher Apollos
approaching on the path, accompanied by the
Princess Drusilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is—this thing you call sin, my Onesimus?
Is it sin for me to love you as I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sin is the shadow of self, shutting out the
light of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pondered that. “And when I love you
so you turn all life to rosy mist, do I love self?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sin is anything that holds us in the realm of
shadows, away from God. It may be crime that
fetters us in blind dungeons without bars like the
Queen Herodias up there in the turret. It may
be gayety. It may be wealth. It may be fear.
It may be love of flesh, or power. It may be
anxious want. It may be doubt; but it is always
shadow of self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is repentance? Would it cut me
off from you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but it would cut you off from planning
to gain power by snaring the Roman General
yonder. Repentance is to cancel sin by sinning
no more, forsaking self and following Light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw her bare arms about his shoulder.
“But if I gained Titus, the Emperor’s son, I could
have you too, Onesimus! You offer me a Shadow
Kingdom I cannot see or touch with hands. I
aim at Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aim, beloved, at the image of clay and
iron seen by the Prophet Daniel; and even now
the iron is falling from the clay and the image is
crumbling down. The other Kingdom is of gold
and light and eternity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two shadows fell athwart where they sat, and
the Princess Bernice drew back, while the young
presbyter rose. Unutterable pain was on his
baffled face. Apollos in his flowing white garments
cast a long giant shadow between them.
His back was towards the bench and so was the
figure of the Princess Drusilla. The towering
Apostle with the white hair and white beard had
raised his shepherd’s crook and was pointing to
the rose-tinted peaks swimming in mystic fire of
clouds and light; and as he pointed his upraised
staff and arms cast a shadow of the cross between
the young presbyter and the slim daughter of the
last of the Herods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder,” he was saying in a voice so like a
silver trumpet that traditions have come in Crete
to this day that when he spoke all the silver bells
of the temple service rang, “Yonder are the
mountains of the wilderness, where our Christ
was tempted. First, He was tempted to satisfy
the hungry cravings of wearied and faint flesh.
Then, He was tempted to try out whether God
was God enough to save Him from rash slips;
and then he was offered all the kingdoms of the
earth and their pageantry as in a dream.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why didn’t He accept the challenge as
a Roman would?” asked the Princess Drusilla in
a cold, hard, calculating voice. “If He could
have proved His Kingdom instead of going to the
Cross like a felon, I’ve heard the Queen Herodias
say all Judea would have risen and rallied to
Him and thrown off Rome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the power given Him of God was not
for service of self, but to lead men back to God.
We may not make playthings of miracles for
self,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So if the Queen Herodias will not acknowledge
your God, you cannot cure her madness?”
demanded Drusilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remorse is not repentance,” answered the
Sage; and the two figures passed on down through
the oleanders of the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rose-tinted misty mountains were wrapping
them in shadow mantles of purpling folds. A cold
wind blew up from the waters, still and glassy
as a painted sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young presbyter stood silent. Bernice
shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you believe in your Unseen Kingdom,
when your King was crucified, and his followers
are now scattered from Judea to these
caves?” she urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death is but a boat across another sullen Jordan
to the Gardens of God,” he said, “and His
Followers are scattered that they may scatter
the seed for the Garden to spread here on earth.
Already the scattered seed reaches from Rome to
Ganges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does Apollos go now?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To become preacher in Crete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To join John, beloved of Christ, at Ephesus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you leave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In an hour to travel in the cool of the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far north, they could see to the snowy peaks
of Hermon, where the sheet lightning played.
The clanking of forges plied in the valley below
on engines of war for the siege of Jerusalem,
echoed like silver bells from cavern and grotto.
The pungent flower-drugged air had odor of
temple incense, and the breeze was as a cool
hand laid on a fevered brow. The shadows
etched themselves clearer in the translucent depths
of the emerald Sea. The young presbyter’s lips
were moving as in prayer. Princess Bernice
roused herself as if to throw off dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis not I who tempt you, Onesimus, with
flesh, or daring, or power. ’Tis you, who tempt
me to abandon the last of the Herod line for a
shadow Kingdom. My brother, King Agrippa,
the last of the Herods, is with Titus besieging
the rebellious Zealots of Jerusalem. I’ll get my
bodyguard, Julius, and join your caravan, and
go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s face lighted up as a brow
in sunrise.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Out under the arched gate they rode in the
moon’s silvered dark, Apollos in a litter on a
camel, leading down the narrow precipitous
causeway. The Princess Bernice, too, rode a
camel, but her form was swathed in cloak; and
the old Idumean rode before her on Arab horse,
while the young presbyter walked by her side.
He carried his sword in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the narrow bridle path from the causeway
led the road to the Jordan and Jericho and
Jerusalem, scarce broad enough for the beasts,
steep and winding as a circular stair. Once where
the way narrowed so that those on stirrups had
to dismount and only the camels kept sure footing,
the Idumean dismounted and held back to
give right of way to the Princess’ beast, before
he turned his own horse and the young presbyter’s
free to let themselves down on their haunches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well rid of her! Well rid of her!” grumbled
the old man. “If she had not been going off
with you, I would not have let her go. Have
you no other Nazarene teachers can rid me of
the other two? Had she attempted to escape to
Titus, the General’s son, I would have cut her
throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down, down, the narrow winding way, the
caravan descended, and where the hot brooding
malarial air of the Jordan smote them, the pebbly
shaly path turned to clay trampled to mire by
the refugees fleeing the siege for open desert and
rocky cave. The current was dark and sullen
and flowed with the hurrying rage of human passion
driving to the nemesis of its own destiny.
The heat was hideous and the din deafened
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the ford of the sullen dark river, they
paused to water their beasts, and mounting his
horse, the young presbyter rode abreast the Princess’
camel and signaled the Idumean to ride for
her safety on the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I ride with you through the Gates
of Death, my Princess,” he whispered, leaning
towards the white face in the muffled cloak.
“ ’Twas here Christ was baptized and tempted
of Self and the Evil One, and renounced all
earthly power to save men for the Glad Kingdom.
You, too, another time in safer place shall join
our ranks by the sacred rite of baptism, my Bernice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the white face answered never a word.
She reached out her arm, where she sat, and
touched his brow with a hand cold as death. Then
the caravan plunged in the ford. The horses
swam and scattered slightly, heading downstream
with the waves, but the camels kept footing and
floundered. As the beasts came panting up the
far bank in a thicket of willows and oleanders, the
Idumean led to force the way, for the narrow
road past Jericho was packed with a slow-moving
mass of fleeing women and children and aged,
escaping from the siege of the Holy City on Zion
Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apollos, the great master, rode back abreast
the Princess, and the presbyter, Onesimus, led her
camel afoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed
with armies, know that the desolation thereof is
nigh,” Apollos said. “Let them which are in
Judea flee to the mountains. They shall fall by
the edge of the sword. They shall be led away
captive into all nations. Jerusalem shall be
trodden down of the Gentiles. When these
things begin to come, then look up, and lift up
your heads; for redemption draweth nigh. Know
you Who spoke those words, your Highness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Princess answered never a word; for
her heart was cold with fear of the sights she
saw as in a shadow by the silver starlight. Where
Herod’s Pleasure Gardens had lain at Jericho,
was such a press of soldiers, they could not approach
the city gates. The clank of the forges
for the engines of war had become as the rumble
of thunder or earthquake. Where she knew the
Holy City must stand on Zion Hill, she could
discern only the blaze of towers and uptossing
in midsky of flaming javelin and torch to throw
destruction inside the city walls; and as the caravan
advanced through the press of legion and
cohort in serried ranks of helmet and breastplate
and spear, the narrow ascending mountain
road lay thick in a screen of smoke with a sickening
odor of burning she had not known could
exist outside the purlieus of a nether world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean came back and wheeled his
horse beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We cannot get through the press though I
break the pate of every head under helmet,” he
said. “We shall have to fork to the right for
the Damascus Road past the General’s tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the smell of burning?” she asked,
leaning forward from the muffle of her camel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dead! They are burning the dead as
they throw them out over the walls in Gehenna
Valley,” answered the old soldier; “and this road
is swimming in blood coming down the walls.
The soldiers tell me it is swimming in blood to
the horses’ bridles beneath Olivet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear nought, Princess,” called the young
presbyter, remounting his horse to guard the
rear, “you are only escaping a world that plays
all men false”, and they pressed on, taking the
road that forked north of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daylight dim with fog and smoke and the dust
of battle saw them on the crest of the highway
that led north from the Holy City towards either
Cæsarea on the Sea, or Damascus in the far
snowy mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paused again to breathe their spent
camels and horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice signaled the young presbyter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have your Arab horse,” she said.
“I cannot ride this beast. He is spent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus helped her to dismount the panting
camel and take place on his own horse, fresh
because he had ridden little. He felt the tremor
of her slender form as he helped her to saddle.
Far as eye could see were tents on the heights
and plains: but the Holy City they could not see
for the fog of smoke and dust and mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One great yellow tent spacious enough to house
a thousand men lay not a hundred yards to the
left of their road. Above it blew the eagle pennants
of Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On,” shouted the old Idumean, “we are safe
here. That is the General’s tent. They have
paused because this is the Jewish Sabbath and
they parley for surrender. To-day will see their
Holy City fall and ring to our trumpets’ victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The caravan moved slowly forward. Soldiers
rose sleepily where they lay on the ground and
saluted the old Idumean. The camels moved
through the mist in grotesque ghosts. Myriad
tents were myriad island peaks in the lifting
morning mist. Then the sun outburst over
the rose-tinted mountains of Moab in the east;
and the trumpets blew in a million echoes through
glen and grotto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mountains and plains seemed to awaken with
myriad soldier forms from ground and tent.
Their metal helmets gave back the morning light
in silvered fire. As the trumpets blew their silvery
blasts amid the echoing rocks, the young
presbyter’s horse reared in panic terror. The
Idumean and the young presbyter sprang to snatch
at the bridle. The <a id='princess'></a>Princess threw out her arm
and struck the trembling creature a blow on its
flank with the bridle rein. It bounded in mid-air
and fled as on winged feet straight for the tent
of the sleeping Roman General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean came a-sprawl on the ground,
rolled over and sprang up with his helmet awry.
The astounded young presbyter had retained his
seat on the wearied camel, but gazed after the
fleeing form as one who has received his death
blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A curse upon her and all her vixen foxy
Herod brood,” raged the old man, getting stiffly
to his feet. “I might have known it was a trick
when she said she would go to the Grecian Isles
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The caravan moved forward again. The old
Idumean was galloping furious as his Arab horse
could leap in wild bounds towards the General’s
tent. Just as the sunlight burst in a shield of
fire over the embattled hosts, the young presbyter
looked back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Idumean had thrown himself from
his horse and stood with drawn lance across the
door to the tent of the sleeping Roman General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And because Peter erred through love in a
slippery place, it gave his great heart tenderness
for all who trust in flesh,” said Apollos. Then
he smiled gently at his young presbyter. “The
old Idumean is closer to truth though he fell hard
and cursed as Peter, than this Princess, blinder
in the fetters of her own wiles than the Queen
Herodias, prisoner back in the Fort,” he said.
“We all have to learn by errors, Onesimus, but
it makes the way longer; and he who follows
truth by a circling road, comes out where he
began.”</p>

<div><h1 id='p_77'>CHAPTER III<br/> <br/> THE SWORD AND THE SUNBURST</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>If a woman is forced by the chain of circumstances
to barter her love for power—is she
justified in bartering herself to the highest
bidder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the thought that chased through the
Princess Bernice’s brain in a dizzy whirl, when
she struck her horse, and bolted from the missioner’s
caravan to force herself on the notice
of the Roman Emperor’s son and make such bargain
as she could with her own charms for coin
to save herself and her brother—the King—from
ruin. Had she ever known a day of freedom of
choice from early girlhood, when she had been
sold to one old husband to steady a tottering
throne, to opening womanhood, when widowed,
she had again been sold like a slave on the
shambles to another aged and repugnant spouse
to win alliance to strengthen that same insecure
throne? And when she had fled from that second
aged buyer on plea of religious vow, her
name had been dirt under the feet of the very
beggars on the street—a byword among the Jews
and a joke among the actors of the Roman theaters
in all the known world. If the world would
hound her to lawlessness for refusing to bow to
legalized slavery, she would accept the challenge
and bid for a power that would put the
world under her feet and reduce the dogs, who
barked, to lick her very hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dogs—dogs—dogs!”—she hated the whole
scheme of life, that made of her love and womanhood
a pawn to lust and power. ’Twas all very
well for the Christian presbyter and the great
revivalist to hurl anathemas at her sin; but was
the sin hers, which had forced her down in the
cesspools of lustful slime? If the world had
made her sin, she would take toll of the world
for her sin and exact tribute that would compensate
her loss for the sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebel? Yes, she knew she was rebel; but who
had turned her into rebel? If she could not fight
Rome, she would exact price from Rome, by beating
it at its own ruthless gamble for power. To
be sure, the presbyter and the revivalist had offered
her refuge from Rome in a Shadowy Kingdom
not made with hands; but had the God of
that Shadowy Kingdom reached down miraculous
hand and saved her from the price she had already
paid? Could all the tears of repentance
and sorrow for that past—which was not her
fault—wipe out the memories that seared her
soul a quivering red? The great revivalist
had warned it was she who was tempting the
young Greek convert of the New Faith. Tempting?
She laughed; and struck her frantic horse
again with all the vicious strength in her woman
arm. It was she, who had been tempted by a
type of love she had not dreamed could exist in
the world of men; and what could she give back
for that type of love—now? An assoiled thing
with drugged memories, which all the waters of
Dead Sea hopes and useless tears could not wipe
out. How easily she could have drawn the young
Greek convert’s lips to her own and drawn his
soul through those lips and held it enchained forever
in enchanted fetters he did not dream! She
loved him too well to make of his life what fate
had made of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed now because she was forever past
tears. She struck the horse again and again because
she would have made all living creatures
suffer a little of what she was suffering; and she
could have screamed in such a fury of incarnate
demon exultation as the warrior women of the
barbarians screamed when they tortured fallen
foe— She would have laughed if the horse had
stumbled and caused her death—that, at least,
would be going down with defiance in the very
teeth of fate; but a frantic horse on devil’s errand
somehow does not stumble. It carries us into the
very pit of fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just as the mists of morning were rising
that some of the soldiers stirred uneasily in
their sleep to the echo of the trumpets and bugles
sounding reveille and the sharp iron-shod pound
of the two horses ridden at furious pace over the
flinty rocks. Some of them sat up wearily. A
few commanders sprang to their feet, sword in
hand. Their first thought was of fresh dispatches
from Rome, or word of surrender from the besieged
Holy City. What they decried through
the rising gauzy mist was the figure of a woman
leaping from her horse in front of the commander’s
tent, followed by a soldier throwing
himself from his horse across her way and
thrusting his lance before the tent entrance. Not
thus had refugees escaping over the walls of the
besieged city by rope come to the Roman for
permission to seek safety in the caves beyond the
Dead Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officers smiled in hard contempt. The
soldiers laughed, an ugly suggestive laugh. They
laughed because they knew that while the war
lasted, if a goddess had come garbed as a woman,
she would not be received in that tent. They
trusted, loved and idolized their commander as
they would a god, and already openly talked of
Titus as the army’s future Emperor, when the
cares of Rome from Gaul to Ganges would have
worn out his father, Vespasian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Roman Legions lay encamped on valley
and hill in front of Jerusalem. Seven months
now had they besieged the Holy City from Passover
Week in spring when a million Hebrews
from every country in the known world had come
up to Jerusalem to celebrate the birth of their
nation from the bondage of slavery in Egypt. It
was now the golden summer season, which we
know as the end of August and opening of September.
Russet mist shimmered on earth and
sky. As the sun rose over the red mountain rims
of Moab far to the east of the Dead Sea, the
gauzy clouds took to themselves wings and rose
to mid-heaven, white as the snow of Hermon in
the north, and joyous as the lark’s greeting to
newborn day.</p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width:90%'>
<img src='images/img082.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seven long months the Roman Legions had
beaten with their huge engines of war against the
three impregnable walls of the Holy City. Beleaguered
and assailants were both exhausted and
had appointed this day a truce; for it was the
Jewish Sabbath. The besieged citizens would
long since have surrendered to Rome; for Rome
had given them peace and prosperity and security
in their own Hebrew laws for a hundred years;
but the mad Zealot Robber Bands and Short
Sword Ruffians, known as the Sicarii, who had
seized the city twenty-thousand strong Passover
Week to plunder in the name of Liberty from
Roman yoke, when all the Temple Chests were
filled with gold tribute from Jews the world over,
knew that surrender meant death, and holding
all the arms of the city, kept the gates of the three
unscalable walls locked against Roman entry or
citizens’ escape. Escape was possible only by
leaping or dropping ropes from the high walls.
Women were held prisoners in the houses, as
cattle for slaughter are hemmed in shambles, to
force the obedience of the men to the mad Zealot
Robber Bands. He who threw himself from the
broad parapet of the upper walls and missed
death in the frantic leap, saw all his kin flung
forcibly over after him by the Zealots, into the
bloody moat beneath the southern precipice, where
the slow burning fires of Gehenna had already
consumed more than six hundred thousand Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all was peace of parley this calm Sabbath
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a watcher appeared on the broad top of
the walls from the Temple on the east to the three
Towers of Herod on the higher Zion to the west.
The world of fighters slept in the dead exhaustion
of men who had lived in armor day and night for
seven months. The footmen of the Roman
Legions sprawled on the ground, helmets and
face pieces still fastened, metal armor still buckled
to breast and thigh. The horsemen lay with
heads pillowed on saddles, their beasts stretched
on the ground beside them, bridle rein crooked in
their elbows, shields thrown for protection across
their lower limbs. The huge battering rams,
which the Romans had hauled up to the walls and
mounted on hurdles of trees and rocks and sod,
rested suspended in mid-air, the giant beams hanging
over the wall for first blow the next day, with
rams’ heads of solid iron twisted and torted from
the smash of seven months’ ceaseless work.
Where the cable, that hauled back the beam coiled
round a horizontal windlass, had been tied to a
stake driven in the ground, a hundred ropemen
lay in a sleep dead as death. The great catapaults,
with jaws of a giant leviathan gripping
rocks for the toss over the walls, also hung silent
and still against the calm sky, with more cables
fast to ground stages and more fighters asleep
with hands not a finger length from the ropes for
the call to fresh fight, when the trumpets should
sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>North of Jerusalem, far as eye could see on
mountain and plain, was a yellow tent city of
Roman Legions grouped round one large marquee
on the central ridge, above which gleamed the
ensigns of the Emperor’s son, Titus, the gleaming
eagle in brass on a lofty pole in front of the commander’s
quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman and the soldier stood facing each
other with blazing eyes before the commander’s
tent. The man did not speak. If Rome won, he
would not risk his head by letting her pass. If
Rome failed, neither would he risk his neck by
offence to an imperious mistress, who was not
wont to be stopped in her will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes blazed. Both breathed hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with that lance.” The woman’s order
was emphasized with a stamp. She had tossed
aside her black cloak, revealing royal purple below
and her right hand sought the pearl-handled
dagger in the gold cord round her waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Emperor sleeps, Princess,” the soldier
gasped back. “One to win favor, had best not
disturb the tired conqueror unannounced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liar,” she said with the quick gleam of an
angry comet, “drop your spear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tent curtain lifted. An unarmed man in
royal vesture like her own emerged as if dazed
from sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Idumean’s lance went up with a flash in the
sun, butt on ground, point in air, held by hand as
of an unseeing statue. The hair of the man in
the tent doorway curled unkempt and damp with
night sweat on his brow. He was unshaven and
bent, unlike soldier mien, as if crushed with
burdens too heavy to be borne. He was still in
the drowse of heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice—Princess—Sister,” he ejaculated.
“Are you ghost—or flesh? In the name of all the
gods of Rome, how came you—here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye—how came her Highness here?” angrily
repeated the old Idumean guard. “And my life
was sworn to hold the two Princesses and the
Queen Herodias safe in Machærus Fort beyond
Jordan while the war lasts; but she tricked me
by tale of joining some Nazarene Christians going
to the Isles of Greece; and when the caravan
passed this way up from the Jordan, she broke
from rank and wheeled her horse affrighted by
the morning trumpets straight for the General’s
tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence—fellow,” ordered the man. “Who
gave you leave to speak? Come inside, my
Sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted the tent flaps, and they passed in.
There was not a soul inside all the great tent but
a Sabean slave laying out his master’s armor for
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Brother—my King—Agrippa—last of
the Herod line,” the woman opened her arms; and
they embraced with the passion of the Herod
line, that loved as it hated, with the hot blood of
the torrid Arab strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go,” the King ordered the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, he turned to the Princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means this—mad—adventure, Sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means, dear Brother, that the Herod women
will no longer endure to be cooped like sheep to
be eaten by wolves yonder in Machærus Fort!
Herod women are of the lion line, my King!
They fight not in cornered walls. They crouch
and spring for the foe’s throat, and never wait
for any foe to strike first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dangerous words, if Rome overhears,”
said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten how, from the male side,
we spring from the unconquered Arab, and from
the other side from Mariamne, daughter of the
greatest of the Hebrew high priests?” demanded
the Princess. “Have you forgotten when the
Great Herod would have broken Mariamne to
his imperious will, she defied him; and when he
slew her, she came back and haunted him till she
drove him mad in that same Machærus Fort?
Have you forgotten how the great Imperial
Cæsar called Herod to Rome, and Herod would
not lower eye or knee in presence of Imperial
Rome; and how for his fearless courage he won
respect of all the Senate in Rome and gained the
Kingdom of Judea, which our Royal House has
held from that day to this? When did Herods
win a kingdom by cringing in fear? Not thus
are kingdoms won, Brother! Old Queen Herodias
grows madder every day with dreams of the
Hermit John’s head slain in the dungeons there.
Sister Drusilla, who has ever been jealous of me
being younger and your favorite, swears she will
join her husband Felix, whether he is in Rome, or
among the barbarians. Know you not if the
Romans win here, the secret Zealots and Sicarii
Sword Ruffians in the Fort there on the Dead Sea
will rise and cut our throats for loyalty to Rome;
and if the Romans lose here, they will tear us to
pieces with bloody hands and feed us to the dogs
beneath the city walls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s head sank forward despairingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have been King in my place, little
lioness! Rome’s luxuries in youth have softened
my Herod daring. I am no longer wild Arab of
the desert willing to wade waist deep in blood to
power. I crave no more kingship, but rest and
peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—confess it not,” scouted the Princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do confess it. I am weary of fighting for
a kingdom to do as Rome bids! If Rome fails,
we are lost. If Rome wins, all Judea will be
ravaged from Galilee to the Dead Sea, and every
city put up on the auction block to the highest
soldier bidder, slave or free. Know you our
royal revenues all come from the tribute taxes of
these cities? Only Felix, the freed slave, sister
Drusilla’s husband, had cunning to foresee. We
of the royal line have been blinded by our own
ambition and mistook a shadow kingdom for the
real. We are only weak shadows of Rome. As
waves Rome’s arm of command, so jumps our
obedient shadow. Rome is crumbling like a
colossal image of clay. Only Felix laid him away
gold enough in strong iron chests to buy a villa
down on Naples Bay, where I had planned to
send Sister Drusilla to her husband; and the
Queen Herodias on to her lord in banishment in
Spain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did you plan to do with me?” asked
the Princess, with the eye of a harrier hawk on a
weakling bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust Titus’ mercy! You have ever been favorite
with him. He likes your wild daring; but
dare not too much! We have been loyal to
Rome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy?” the Princess Bernice laughed. “Is
that the Great Herod’s voice I hear in the last of
the Herod line? Do you also plan to march with
shackles on hands and balls on feet behind the conqueror’s
car under the Triumphal Arch at Rome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, dearest Princess, my lioness,” answered
King Agrippa, caressing his sister’s hands. “Have
you forgotten how a year ago we stood on the
Bridge of Fate that runs from the temple roof
across the middle lower city to Herod’s palace on
the west, to plead with the high priests to stem
this revolt against Rome; and the whole populace
of Jerusalem took up stones to kill us? Only the
height of the bridge saved our lives. Have you
forgotten the shameful names they shouted at
you—Rahab, they called you—a Herod Princess—because
you had left your ancient spouse up in
Cilicia and came down to pay your vows in Jerusalem—you,
my Queen sister, the daughter of the
high priests back to Aaron? Have you forgotten
the insults they hurled at me, for defending you—my
favorite Sister—though never Herod did more
for the Jews than I have done? What would you
if we trust not Titus’ gratitude?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gratitude,” the Princess harshly laughed.
“Gratitude, the sour-milk diet of weakling fools
and coward hopes.” She drew back from her
brother and screened her face by throwing her
purple cloak over her shoulder as she spoke.
“What would I do? I’d do what every high
priest’s woman has had to do since Miriam,
Aaron’s sister, beat the timbrels of victory on the
Red Sea. I’d rule the man! I’d ride with the
conqueror in his car beneath Rome’s Arch of
Triumph! I’d turn a shadow kingdom into a real
earth power ruled with iron grip though it were
fleshed in woman. They call us—weak.” She
laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d send Drusilla with her dove-cooing love to
her slave husband Felix on Naples Bay. I’d send
the old drooling Queen Herodias to her doting
failure of a spouse in Spain to waste their souls
away in vain regrets; but I’d strike, and I’d strike
now, straight at Titus’ heart for the throne of
Rome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that—not that way, my Queen, my
Sister,” her brother drew back in horror. “Know
you what names the populace call you, my royal
Sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A curse on these barking dogs! What care I
for the curs of the gutter? He who fights curs,
finds himself snarling in their gutter. We Herods
have given Judea security for a hundred years.
What have they given us? They have snapped
hands that fed them royal bread, free. Let the
Romans conquer and throw every Judean over the
walls to the fires of Gehenna, or sell the seditious
slaves to Egypt for the price of dogs. Think you,
beloved Brother, that I have not sacrificed love
for power? I left the only man that ever I loved
in my life but you—my King, to break from the
caravan to the Isles of Greece, and come to Titus,
here. Yes, the Greek slave—Onesimus, from
whom you parted me in the Gardens of Daphne
long ago, now grown to man majestic as a gladiator!
He offered me the shadow kingdom of his
Christ, and my weak heart might have yielded to
that love had I not seen the Emperor’s tent here
when the mist rose; but I would not drop the real
kingdom of Rome within our grasp for all shadow
kingdoms of all the prophets since time began.
What have the prophets done for us, Brother?
Show me a kingdom I can grasp; and I’ll close
my clutch on what I feel. I grasp not rainbows,
my Agrippa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>King Agrippa sank to his cot with his face in
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you ride with the Emperor in his chariot
under the Triumphal Arch, know you what Rome
will say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do I care what Rome says? Can
Rome say worse than these Judeans have shrieked
as we rode through the streets? What care I
what Roman rabble bawls if I rule Rome? With
the army in Titus’ strong hands, the Senate will eat
from our hands, whipped curs. Where is Titus?
Take me to him, Brother! We can save the last
of Herod’s line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>King Agrippa rose irresolute. The Princess
had stung him to action; but one, who must be
stung to action, must be kicked on by prods in
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I cannot, Sister Bernice, though you
were Queen of Heaven.” King Agrippa began
pacing the tent. “We have a remnant of the
Roman garrison secure in the three great Towers
of Herod, whence the Zealots and Sicarii Sword
Ruffians have been unable to drive them out—they
are our old loyal garrison of a year ago; and
they have ample water in the roof cistern, to hold
out till we go in. That’s why our engines have
avoided throwing rocks at the west Towers.
With them are three of the Nazarenes who refused
to be driven to revolt. Our spies tell us
these Nazarenes have rescued all the sacred
scrolls from the Ruffians now in the Temple to the
east, and carried them for safe-keeping to Herod’s
Towers by the secret Aqueduct that runs from
beneath the Temple to Herod’s Palace on the
west. You would be safe there; but I—cannot—take
you there. The Overhead Bridge from the
Temple to the Palace has been smashed by the
great rocks we have been throwing over the walls,
and the Aqueduct from the Altar to the Palace
is filled with rotting dead and plunder—the rebel
bands drove the high priests under, and cut their
throats in the Aqueduct, and the Temple floor
now swims in blood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And think you, Brother, my feet are so dainty
they would spurn to wade in the blood of these
dogs or trample the rotting bodies of high priests
to gain our end? Have you forgotten how Herod
the Great had strangled, beneath the baths of
Machærus, his wife’s brother, who was High
Priest, to gain his end; and how when his best
loved wife taunted him with murder and turned
from him in hate, though he loved her to madness,
he slew her, too, and stopped at naught to
make his throne secure? I am such a Herod
daughter! Shall we let slip what he paid such
price to gain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King’s brows knitted deep. Though scarce
past mid-life, he bent with the impotence of fate
too powerful for him to master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, I cannot risk the General’s anger if
we disobey his orders. There is truce to-day. It
is the Jewish Sabbath. The Emperor is for
mercy and letting famine force surrender. We
have the city hemmed on every side. They must
surrender or starve. But the army will not hear
of another day’s delay! It will hurt our Emperor’s
prestige! We shall marshal all our strength
this day to show the Jews inside, there cannot
escape one living soul from our circle of fire and
sword. If they surrender not to-night, neither
old nor young, nor man nor woman, shall escape
the sword; and when the sword is dulled of
slaughter, all others will be sold as slaves. The
soldiers are now down in the burning moat stealing
coins from the dead to buy slaves at the price
of a dog, and not a man in rank dare break the
truce on pain of death! The General and his
young lieutenant, Trajan, are in the turrets of
Antonia’s Tower next to the Temple. Titus has
not left off to lead for one hour from Passover
Week. Till victory perches on his eagle, he does
not know that woman exists; and if he did, he’d
bid his soldiers knock her on the head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pah!” she laughed. “You know not woman’s
power on man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is no man—Titus is iron, my Sister—I
occupy his tent alone! Not one night for seven
months has he slept in his bed; or known rest; or
taken off his armor. He is soldier now, and not
lover dangling on a woman’s whim. He fights
hand to hand with Jews. Last night we had
mined from Antonia’s Tower under the Holy of
Holies, and if the Jews do not surrender this
eventide, we break through. The orders are to
slay and slay. The Jews suspect. They must
have heard our pickaxes below the Temple breaking
a hole in the wall of the foundation. Their
soldiers crowd all the upper galleries of the
Temple to pour down boiling pitch and set fire
if we enter. Our spies tell us even now these
swine Zealots lie in stupor drunk with the holy
wine mixed with Roman blood all over the sacred
Temple floor. One, son of Lazarus of Bethany,
escaped from the walls by rope last night, and
told us the rotting dead pile the streets, and the
living pace pale shadows faint from famine; and
when the Zealots broke into the houses of the
prisoned women to search for food one Jewess of
Arabian Petra fed these ravening beasts her own
child boiled for flesh; and then laughed and told
them, and stabbed herself to death raving
vengeance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sister and brother paused and gazed desperately
in each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no hope but to trust the Roman
Emperor’s mercy,” repeated King Agrippa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rome’s mercy!” Princess Bernice laughed, and
her voice was hard as sword striking metal.
“Sheep for hungry wolves! Would Herod the
Great have hesitated and whined ‘mercy, mercy,’
to wolves, as we pause now, Brother of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herod the Great dealt not with Titus. He
dealt with a cringing Senate. This Titus is a
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if he is man, I—am—woman. Know
you what that means? Take me to Titus, though
we wade in blood to our waists! Be not less than
man, yourself. Shall my power be less because
he is man? Do you remember your mad jealousy
when we were younger? Do you think I’ll fail
with him because he is man? I have had two weak
kings for husbands! Now I aim for an Emperor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice—are you mad? Do you know the
price you’ll have to pay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Price? Fool!” she scouted. “Do I know
the price I’ve paid to man since I was a little
child? This time, I’ll get paid for all I barter if
I have to cut his throat while he sleeps—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman—,” he threw his hand across her lips.
“You risk both our lives with your mad talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew his hand from her lips and kissed it
as she drew back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who go in as spies, Brother?” she pressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who risks his life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll risk my life—if you will do as much,”
she urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not have the royal line of the
Herods creep into their kingdom spies?” he
wavered; and in his wavering, she saw the triumph
of her old power and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have the royal Herod line creep
through the fires of Hades to grasp a real kingdom
instead of this shadow of Rome’s leavings,”
she answered. “Go to the Tower of Antonia and
get Titus’ permission! Tell him you have found
a woman of the high priest caste who will go in
as spy. Tell him she will take refuge in Mariamne’s
Palace of the Herod Towers—to give her
pass to the remnant of the Roman Garrison there!
Tell him she will throw over the walls each day
from the dovecots of the Queen’s Tower news of
all that passes inside the walls.” She clapped
her hands. The old Idumean came stiffly in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Julius, follow King Agrippa up to Antonia’s
Tower. Take your station where the Roman sappers
have mined the wall to the Temple. Bide
there till I send you word by page lad! Sharp
your short sword as you wait and get helmet that
will meet your breastplate at the neck! Be sure
to protect your neck—you’ve only one! When
the lad comes ask no question! Leap through
into the Temple and lift the pavement of the floor
before the Altar into the Aqueduct. Drop the
lad through below! Then escape for your life
back through the hole in the wall! If you succeed,
you shall have free farm and pension all
your life. If you fail, your tongue shall be torn
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled joyously as the old Idumean went
out; and then she bade King Agrippa get her the
garments of his page boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the tenth hour of the stone dial in
front of the Imperial tent, a page lad walked out
following King Agrippa. He wore a cloak and
his turban cap came down over his ears to his
very eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the terraced garden below the outer walls
had been cut to the roots. Palm and cactus and
hedge and olive trees had gone to build the huge
hurdles on which the idle battering rams stood
suspended in mid-air. Just once the page paused
and swayed as he followed the king going up to
Antonia Tower. ’Twas where the Romans had
torn down the first and second walls of the Holy
City. On the angle of a projecting bastion on
the inner third wall, where those on the parapet
above could see, swung the rotting skeletons of
five hundred Jews crucified hanging by their spiked
hands. Their loose garments blew to the wind
and the ravens still circled above the featureless
blackening skulls. Where the battering rams
rested motionless above the parapets, bags filled
with sand and dripping inky pitch showed how the
besieged had fought back by firing the hurdles and
engines of war. Rumor ran through the Roman
camp how an old blind follower of Herod the
Great, let down by ropes to work he could not see,
had fired and burned the first hurdles. But for the
creaking of the ravens perched on the turrets of
the towers and fighting over the black skulls,
the silence was of an awfulness that was stabbed
by every footfall. Once or twice the page saw
gaunt figures on the wall top appear like phantoms
and toss naked dead over to the burning
moats below; and down in the burning moats
could be seen ghoulish figures of the Roman
Army searching the dead for coin to buy slaves
in victory. A quick catch of breath broke from
the page. King Agrippa looked sharply back but
did not pause. Javelins, darts, broken arrows,
bent spears, crumpled shields littered the dust
where gardens had once terraced the hills. The
ground was hot beneath the page’s sandals as
though seethed in flame. By the Tower of Antonio
in front of the Temple, trickles of red
clotted blood black with flies ran out under the
demolished walls.</p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width:90%'>
<img src='images/img099.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, they had vaulted the clutter of crumbled
stones in the lowest story of Antonia’s Tower
where its east wall joined the Temple. Where
the broken wall was plugged by plank and bag,
a cohort of Romans stood guard silent as stone.
The King raised his right hand. The old Idumean
came forward so swathed in sheet of mail
and leggings of chain greaves he could scarce be
recognized but for the stiffness of his aged legs.
In his right hand, he carried a long sword, in
his left the short circular dirk such as the Sicarii
Sword Ruffians inside bore. Not a word was
uttered. The old soldier, disguised as Zealot,
moved forward and pulled some bagging from
the hole in the wall. Head first, then right leg,
he stepped through the hole. With frantic look
of appeal as a dumb brute going to its doom
might cast in affectionate farewell to a loved
master, the page glanced back at the pale face
of King Agrippa. Then, he followed the disguised
soldier through the hole in the wall and
the Romans stuffed the bagging and plank back
in place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were inside the sanctuary of the Holy
Place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence was of a tomb. Gone was the
golden Altar. Gone were golden cherubim and
seraphim above the Altar of which the Psalmist
sang. Gone were the golden candlesticks in mystic
sevens. Gone were the great golden basins and
the brass brazier in which the priests had burned
sacrifices for the people’s sins from the days of
Solomon. Gone were the cunningly wrought
tapestries of Damascus and Babylon in woven
gold and blue and purple and scarlet, which veiled
the Holy of Holies in mystic purity from profane
gaze. Ax and sword had hacked the sheathing
of gold and silver from the pillars to each side
supporting the cloisters and galleries. And where
were the mystic treasure boxes between pillars,
in which the Jews hoarded the offerings of the
faithful through the fateful centuries? The
Babylonians had rifled these treasures long centuries
ago; but they had left the treasure chests.
So had Antiochus of the North; but even he could
not destroy these great iron boxes, though he
had offered swine upon that vanished altar; and
when Herod the Great had restored the Temple,
these treasure chests had been left filled and untouched
for a hundred years. Again the page
swayed as faint; for sprawled on the pavement
floor lay drunken Sicarii Ruffians in the dead sleep
of swinish debauch, with sword in one hand, the
golden flagons and cups of the altar service in
the other, and they slept on a floor thickening
with human blood. A slight tremor ran through
the Temple, as of an earthquake from the Dead
Sea; or was it that the senses of the page swam
at what he saw? The Temple pavement seemed
to heave and sink. The great Golden Gate to
the east—ninety feet it was in height—swung
open as of unseen hands, flooding the horror with
a burst of sunlight. The page covered his face
with his hand. Was this the crumbling kingdom
of reality for which one grasped, rejecting that
other shadow kingdom not made with hands, but
made of rest and peace and light and love and
eternity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius, the old Idumean, with one eye gleaming
through his vizor on the swinish forms asleep,
and his long sword in his right hand, was prying
with the dirk in his left to hoist the stone that
gave secret drop to the dry Aqueduct below.
The stone lifted as on hinges. The old Idumean
laid down his right-hand long sword, grasped the
page by the neck, signaled him to catch the edge
of the black hole for the drop and was still holding
the trapdoor up, when either the tremor
of the earthquake, or the flood of sunburst from
the Golden Gate, disturbed the sleepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, you tricky she-vixen of hell,” the Idumean
hissed, “and hang by your hands, which
I’ve trapped, till Rome rots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bernice, the Princess, had thrust up one
arm in a sudden revulsion at the drop in the
under dark and caught the descending trap door
with the palm while she hung suspended by her
right hand from the edge. The noise had roused
the sleepers. They were on him with a howl of
tigerish fiends. She saw him snatch at his long
sword, miss it, leap back, strike out with his short
dirk sword. The iron-shod boot slipped on the
bloody floor. He fell with a crash of armor on
stone. They sprang on his outstretched arms, his
mail-clad legs, his metal breastplate, hacking at
the chain thighs with their swords. Her last
glimpse of the old Idumean was of him shoving
his chin down to meet the breastplate and save
his neck from their spears. Then a great broadsword
crashed down. His metal head piece went
bounding over the floor with a gush of livid blood.
Her hand hold gave from the edge of the trap
door. The stone slipped back to its place in the
floor, and she dropped to bottom in the dark of
the Aqueduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was black as night. She paused to think
which way was west. Which way lay the Herod
Palace? Had she turned as she swung on the
edge of the trapdoor—and dropped? Then back
in her dim memories of all the glories of the
Herod line—was it memory or a throwback of
the mad daring blood in her own daring veins?—came
half consciousness of how Herod the
Great in like case let down by baskets into robber
caves of Galilee, black as the night of this Aqueduct,
had plunged on fearless in the dark, and
driven the cave robber bands over the precipice to
a man. She boldly advanced through the dark. By
the feel of her feet, the stone footing beneath
was descending. That, she knew must be wrong;
for the dry Aqueduct was used to flush water from
the Altar out east from the pools at the Palace
west. She turned. The Aqueduct ascended.
That must be right; for waters do not flow up;
and it was the Palace pools that flushed the Aqueduct
to drain the Temple, and she fled through
the dark like a night demon. Was this the price
she must pay for a kingdom of which not one stone
would be left upon another by sunrise if the
Jews did not surrender that very day to Rome?
Fool! Judea was lost. It was at Rome she aimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her foot tripped. ’Twas but the plundered
gold of the Temple chests, she knew by the rattle
of coin on stone; and she sped on through the
dark. Then an odor struck her in the face that
is like no other odor on earth. It was the odor
of those long dead in damp. She swayed faint
against the circular arch of the Aqueduct and like
a flash in the night came memory of the tales
of long ago—these were the high priests that
Herodias’ lord had spurred to crucify the Christus
of the Nazarenes. Her breath came in gasps.
Was she to perish here haunted forever by that
Christian cross, which the line of Herods had
risked all to destroy in order to perpetuate a
crumbling kingdom? Her sandal touched a soft
and naked thing. She leaped over the tangled
mass of unseen putrid flesh and ran till her forward
right hand touched bronze gate beneath the
Towers of Herod’s Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three raps she gave, and then four, in the
mystic number of the Hebrew seven. It was the
Roman pass to deceive the Jews in their own
mystic number. No answering sound came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rapped again, three—then four—louder
and yet louder and could hear her own muffled
heart beats in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the old Idumean, whom she had tricked,
perished trapping her in revenge? Her heart
beat till she thought her temples would burst;
and she saw as in colored fires the bloody head
of the Hermit John, who had taunted Herodias
to madness; the ghostly wraith of Mariamne,
Herod’s murdered wife; the pale face of the
Nazarene, James, whom her own Herod husband
had ordered stoned to death—then circles of fire
went whirling before her eyes and in the circles
a fiery cross with the crucified figure of that Son
of Man—she screamed and beat on the bronze
door with her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a century before seven faint taps
sounded back from the other side of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rapped again frantically, beating the door
with her clenched fist and screaming “ ’Tis I—Princess
Bernice—open—open—open the doors!
For the love of God, open the doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she sank to her knees, with the fiery
circles whirling in her dying consciousness, and
in the midst of the circles ever the dangling figures
of crucified men on a wall. The bronze door
creaked, and rasped, and swung open. A Roman
soldier, wan with hunger, stood in the dim light.
He fell back as if from a ghost and would have
clashed the bronze door shut; but she thrust the
pass from Titus in his amazed hand and fainted
across the threshold at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Must a woman ever pass through the portals
of hell to gain her end?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She risked her mother’s life in gaining birth.
She risked her own in giving birth; and was this
the end? Why was woman accursed? Was
there no redemptive power in all the long chain
of circumstances to free her from the power of
that ancient curse for grasping at the Tree of
Life? What was life? ’Twas life she had
snatched at and lo! a flaming sword of fire—circles
of fire and in the center ever the cross of
a crucified love. Then, in her delirium, Onesimus,
her lover, was bending over her in the Garden
of Ardath, the Paradise of Flowers; and
every flower was a child’s soul; and through her
veins ran a flame that did not burn but was of
the very essence of light; and at her feet lay
no Dead Sea of tears but ran with the laughing
glad voice of many waters Rivers of Life—and
their vesture was of the light of the very sun.
They did not need to speak. They knew without
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flame was no longer fiery sword—it was
golden light; and her lover was trying to tell her
that light was love, golden as the dawn over the
swimming mountains of Moab—over which they
two seemed mounting in chariots of fire—when
an unseen hand, white as fuller’s earth, snatched
him from her—and she was falling—falling—falling—sinking
with the dead weight of her humanity
straight to that Dead Sea of tears—the
laughter now was not the glad voice of many
waters—it was the shrieking mockery of the
Roman world. She was marching with ball on
feet and gyves on wrists under the Triumphal
Arch of Rome; and all Rome was pointing fingers
of scorn at the naked captive daughter of the
Herod kings; and the rabble dogs were snapping
at the captive lines. She awakened with a piercing
scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was she living or dead? She was past caring.
Let Fate do its worst. She looked up. Slowly
she recognized one of the Palace chambers of
Mariamne’s Tower; but whether the chambers
were real or dream, she did not know. But
seven months before, she and King Agrippa had
fled from the threats of the populace beneath the
Overhead Bridge to this very Tower. She had
played in it as child, and wantoned in it as girl,
and plotted in it as woman. She had drunk wine
of life in that very Tower; and were these the
lees of the wine, that at last would sting as a
serpent? She sat up on her couch. Beside her
stood the pale Roman soldier of the garrison and
an aged Jewess. A mid-life man stood in the
chamber door. An aged and venerable figure
looked over her shoulder. One who seemed physician
was pressing a brew to her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are these people?” she whispered
faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not, daughter,” gently answered the
aged woman. “We are Nazarenes, followers of
the Christ. It is no poison that Luke, the physician,
would give you! He, too, is a follower of
the Nazarene, though he is Greek. I am the
mother of Mark, who has ever dwelt in Jerusalem.
The aged apostle is Matthew, who used
to gather taxes for the Romans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the instinct of fear, that haunted all the
Herod blood and drove that blood from crime
to crime, came over her awakening consciousness
in a flood of memory; for had she not as girl
stood on that Bridge between Temple and Palace
when her own Herod kin had urged the Jewish
mob to drag James, the crucified Christ’s kinsman,
out to death by stone and spear? How she
had laughed at the rabble then, and clapped her
hands to see them hound the Nazarene preacher
out from the Temple to his doom! And now
that rabble, if they knew she was here, would
tear her to pieces with bloody hands and throw
her to the pavements for the dogs to lick her
blood. And then the instinct of craft, that ran
in her Herod blood, gave voice in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you call me daughter?” she whispered
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she felt her hair which had fallen
about her neck as she fled through the Aqueduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Matthew, here, recognized you as
King Agrippa’s sister. What word of the Roman
Army? Will they win the last wall to-day? When
we let down the baskets for food last night, the
Zealots threw pitch bags and burned the ropes.
We dare no longer venture out on the Palace parapet.
They shoot fire arrows. And not one of
us will leave the others. Whether we live, or
whether we die, it is nothing, daughter! The
Zealots may slay the body. They cannot slay
the soul. But what tempted you to come through
the Aqueduct, child? Is to-day the end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer, the silver trumpets blew from turret
and tower, from hill and plain, from cavern
and grotto. The group rushed from the chamber
for the turret window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bear my cot to the window,” she commanded,
the old imperiousness of Princess and daughter
of high priests surging back in her reviving consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down sheer seventy feet from the turret window
to the plain where the Roman Legions had
mustered, they gazed—first Titus, the Emperor’s
son, on a black stallion; then Trajan, his young
officer, on a white horse; then her brother, King
Agrippa, on a low Arab fawn-colored steed, all
in trappings of brass with silver shields aslant
the horses’ shoulders; then the standard bearers
with the Roman eagle in gold; then the pikemen,
clad in mail, with their long lances like fields of
wheat; then the horsemen in darker mail with
lances aslant like knives moving in rank; then the
great engines of war that moved on wheels like
erect walls; then the Macedonian mercenaries on
foot, six and seven rank deep they wheeled and
marched and countermarched; while one Josephus
rode on a white charger up to the walls shouting
out: “Why would they die and not surrender
to the clemency of Rome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cowed populace answered never a word,
but the Zealots and swordsmen swarmed to the
broad tops of the walls with hoots of derision.
Stones rained down on the emissary for peace.
They hissed his words with shameless insults,
and bade the Romans not draw back in cowardice
because this was Jewish Sabbath, but to
come on and dare to try the third strong wall.
When the peace emissary would have shouted
again, those on the wall threw a naked dead body
in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wild warrior blood of her Herod Arab
ancestors surged through Bernice’s veins. She
knew then the urge that had driven her through
the Aqueduct. She could have leaped from the
walls to join the Romans down there fighting in
carnival of blood had she been man. Why had
she been born woman—the tool—instead of man,
the hand that wielded the tool? She knew she
was a rebel against Fate; but had not Herod
the Great been rebel, too, till he mastered Fate
and made himself King? She tore her purple
girdle from her waist and waved it at the conquerors
from the turret window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Roman trumpets faded in fainter echo.
The marchers and counter marchers encircled the
city in a ring of swords. Bernice from the Tower
saw that the hired Macedonian mercenaries had
been thrust forward first. She knew what that
meant—these were the swordsmen of the world
paid in plunder—there would be no mercy. Those
not slain would be sold as slaves, the men for
the mines, the women—for what? Was this the
Kingdom for which she grasped? A silence
fell for a moment on the terrific confused clamor
within the city. A melancholy wail of woe came
up from the central valley between Temple and
Palace, and some madman’s maniacal scream resounded
from the parapets to the Tower—“Woe—woe—woe
is Jerusalem! How is that great
Babylon drunk with the blood of the prophets
fallen! Jerusalem shall fall this day! There
shall not be left one stone upon another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were not those the very words of our Lord,
when you admired the beauty of the Temple?”
asked Mark. “Peter bade me to put that in his
Gospel of our Lord’s life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So every disciple has related to me, and so
I have written in His Life, for the Greek churches
of Asia,” answered the physician, Luke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we thought he had come to set up earthly
kingdom in this Temple,” said the venerable
Matthew. “And now we know it is a Kingdom
not made with hands for which all Time has
prepared, and this earthly kingdom shall vanish
quite away for a New Heaven, and a New Earth.
This is the passing of the Old. These are the
birth pangs to the New. Let us read what the
scrolls of the prophets have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the three Apostles withdrew to a circular
brass table in the middle of the Tower. On the
brass table were carved the signs of the zodiac
and the time of day pointed by an arrow as the
outer sun swung round; but the Princess Bernice
had no thought for what the scrolls of the
prophets might say. An ancient urge was in her
blood, old as those stars from which the astrologers
had cast the horoscope of fate in the signs
of the Zodiac. Again Roman power with its
cohorts in silver and its legions with spears like
fields of waving grain seemed a realer realm than
a shadow kingdom not made with hands adown
long future ages. How could she serve the Emperor
to bind his gratitude to give her foothold
on the ladder up to this earthly Imperial Throne?
She had said she would wade through the blood
of the living or trample the putrid dead; and she
had done both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lull fell like the silence between the crash of
two monster ocean billows. It was almost eventide,
the end of the Jewish Sabbath, and the
mountains were folding them in purple mantles
like royal kings at rest, when the voices of the
others in the room behind caught her ear. Luke,
the Greek doctor, was speaking and pointing to
the signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thought He spoke of time when He spoke
of eternity. Here is the zodiac of Egypt and
Chaldea. Here is their prophecy, when the star
brought the Persian magi to the Bethlehem
manger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bethlehem? She hated the very name of Bethlehem.
Had not her Aunt Herodias often told
her the evil destiny of the Herods dated from
the massacre of infants there? Then she remembered
that the door from the hideous horrors
of the Aqueduct had only opened when she called
out in the name of the Love of God. What was
this new thing coming in the war of worlds for
power? But the pageantry of life blotted the
answer to that question, and she heard as in an
unreal dream the reading of the ancient scrolls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” the doctor Luke was pointing to the
zodiac, “here is the Scorpion, that Lucifer who
fell from heaven from vaunting pride and set
out to lead man astray to fill his kingdom. Here
is Taurus the Bull, worshiped by Egypt and
Chaldea which Abraham fled. Here are the Sun
worshipers, when Israel burnt her sons upon the
walls. Here is the Virgin, Mother of a Child
in flesh to reveal God in form to man. Here is
Pisces the Fisher, and when our Christians fled
from Nero’s sword in Rome they used the Fisher
sign to know one another. Christ said, ‘I make
you fishers of men,’ and we knew not what he
meant. The fall of Jerusalem is the fulfilment
of our age. After our age, when the sword shall
give place to sunburst comes the Age of Air and
water and freedom with much going to and fro
beyond the Isles of the Sea to nations not yet
born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read from our own prophets and not from
the astrologers of Chaldea and Egypt,” requested
the aged Matthew. “Why have these evils
fallen on the City of Zion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mark, the youngest of the three, took up a
cylinder of brass. From it he drew a parchment
scroll written in Hebrew and rolled round a rod.
“Here, Luke, you are a doctor of learning. You
read the Hebrew. We Hebrews have not spoken
our tongue since captive days in Babylon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luke took the scroll and went to the window
to see the clearer in the dimming light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus saith Jeremy,” he said, slowly translating
in a patois of Aramaic and tradesman Greek.
“Behold—our—reproach—our inheritance is
turned to strangers—our house to aliens. We
are orphans and fatherless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Servants have
ruled over us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is none that doth deliver
out of their hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We get our bread
by the peril of our lives because of the sword
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our skin is black because of the famine
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they ravish the women of Zion and the maids
in the cities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. princes are hanged by their
hands .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Mountain of Zion is desolate.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That of this Age,” broke in Matthew. “We
shall see the fulfilment of that to-night; but what
of the ages when the Time of the Sword has
passed? Read Ezekiel, Brother Luke—what says
he of the nations of the North beyond the Isles
of the Sea? What says he of the Age of Freedom?
What says he of the Age of the Air
when the Sword has given place to Sunburst?
What meant our Lord when He said greater
miracles than He worked should the world see
before the end of Time? What signs will foreshadow
a New Heaven and a New Earth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luke turned the spool of the scroll and ran
his finger from right to left— “Is this the Age
of Air?” he asked, then he read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A whirlwind came out of the North, a great
cloud, and a fire unfolding itself, and a brightness
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and out of the midst of the fire the
color of amber .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and this was the likeness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every one had four wings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. their
feet were straight and sparkled like burnished
brass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the hands of men were under the wings
on the four sides .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they had faces and wings
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the wings were joined one to another and
turned not when they traveled .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they went
straight forward with unmoving wings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
signs of the nation a lion, an ox, and an eagle
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two wings they had joined each to other on
each side .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. straight forward they went whither
the spirit wished to go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with burning coals
of fires and lamps in front .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. up and down in
the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. up and down in the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and their
fire went forth as lightning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but upon the earth
they used wheels .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there were whirling rings
in front .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dreadful to see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but when the
wings were lifted the wheels were lifted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
in the firmament their likeness was a terrible
crystal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the noise of the wings was the
rush of many waters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when they stood, they
let down their wings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means that?” demanded Mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the bent figure of the Apostle’s mother
had risen with outstretched hands and in her eye
was the light of ancient prophetess. It was as
if she saw a Light with eyes of spirit, which eyes
of flesh could not see—adown long, long Ages
mid races of beings not yet guessed, nor born in
thought. Her whole figure seemed aflame in
vesture of unearthly shining Light. Mystic was
she, prophetess, seeress, with eyes boring into the
Far Future like stars piercing midnight dark. It
was as if a flash of lightning suddenly tore through
the impenetrable veil of Life concealed; as if an
invisible Torch Bearer threw a flashlight on the
Far Future. “When the Age of the Sword shall
pass for the Sunburst of the Prince of Peace, there
shall come dominion over the princes of the
powers of the air,” she slowly uttered, as one in
trance of vision. “Greater things than these shall
ye do, and the Old Things are passing away for
the New; and Jerusalem must needs be destroyed
to give place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A terrific crash drowned the words. The siege
of the last wall had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Palace rocked and vibrated with blows of
the battering rams. Huge stone blocks from the
engines of war smashed down into the Eternal
City between Palace and Temple; and a fearful
cry of throngs crushed as they ran, rent the air.
A great light flooded the darkening room of the
Herod Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All dashed to the turret window. A flame
leaped with the roar of livid sea to very mid-heaven
of the vaulted blue. The Temple was on
fire. The Romans were inside the last wall.
Fiery swords, bucklers, battle axes, javelins, arrows,
flaming balls of naptha went tossing in
mid-air as the Zealots on the roof plunged in the
flames, or flung themselves to death in the burning
moats from the walls. Jerusalem rained fire
from the defenders on the parapet. The roar of
the seething torrents drove all the city into the
street and over the prostrate bodies rode the
horsemen slashing with spear and sword, sparing
neither women nor children, inflamed by the defiant
insults to the proffered peace and insane
with the demon lust for blood and plunder, held
back these weary months. The Palace rocked
again. Bernice leaned far out from the turret
window. Just as the afterglow of the mystic
sunset colored the heights of the Holy City, a
mirage of chariots and troops struck the flaming
clouds in shadow—the destruction of a shadow
kingdom of sword and power. Armies, principalities
and powers—seemed to be fighting in rolling
billows of flame. The Princess hid her face
in her hands on the window casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerusalem had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if all the evils of all past ages in all
past cycles of time crashed down in one vibrant
shock that shook the world; as if the iron bands
of law and order and empire forged in the furnaces
of that Ancient of Days—had burst asunder;
as though a great Tidal Wave from Eternity
had submerged another Atlantis and thrown
up in the wreckage on the Shores of Timeless
Eternity another race, another age, another order.
The terrible cry, that ascended to Heaven, was
the cry of a Dying World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kingdom of the Herod line for which
she had risked her life and sacrificed her love
was crumbling to dust and ashes under her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Old had passed away for the New; and
Fate had rejected her pawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came the iron-shod trample of soldiers running
up the stone stairs of the Herod Tower, and
King Agrippa broke into the room followed by
Titus, the emperor’s son, and Trajan, the youthful
lieutenant, all faces blackened with the smoke
of battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are safe here, my Sister,” cried the last
ruler of the Herod line. “The fire cannot touch
these Towers. All the city but these Herod
Towers will be laid flat as plain by morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where,” demanded Titus, “is the Princess
page, who risked her life running through
the Aqueduct this morning to do Rome service?”
And Titus was not such a figure as her dreams of
power had painted. He was a plain, short, thickset
soldier, with keener eye for spear than
woman’s guiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she stood erect and proud as Herod the
Great had stood before the Roman Senate many
long years ago. The daughter of high priest and
King, she would meet Fate face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Small chance I had to do Rome service, my
Lord,” she said. “Your brave legions captured
the prize before I could add my woman help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when my soldiers guessed that the woman
who had broken through the ranks in the morning
to enter my tent was the page boy first to
enter the hole in the wall to the Temple court,
they swore they would take the city to-night, or
perish to a man. Think you my Romans would
be less men than a weak little Princess?” That
word “weak” with its commiseration of male
strength for child woman smote her hopes in the
face like an iron gauntlet. She had played an
ancient game with an ancient pawn—and lost,
as Eve lost in an ancient garden; and she knew
now what brought defeat to woman; and she knew
now if she had answered the true urge of her
heart, how she could have turned defeat to victory
and wielded greater power with unseen hands
than all Rome’s strength. Man could slay, but
only woman could give life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were the wine to my men’s flagging courage,
my little Princess,” he said. “What reward
do you claim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord,” she said, hiding her defeat in his
chivalry, “when the chariots enter the Triumphal
Arch at Rome, the last of the Herod line would
not pace behind in captive chains. Let them
perish rather. They would ride with the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conqueror did not answer at once. He
was turning over that request in his shrewd soldier
mind. He smiled slowly as a man might
smile at a child playing with a sharp sword which
he had snatched from its hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was for that you risked your life,
child?” He laughed; and then his face saddened.
He did not see the hidden appeal of the dark
eyes gazing into his, though the young Trajan
laughed brusquely and King Agrippa turned his
reddening face away. “It is not mine to grant
your request. Rome glories not in the blood of
any race. My father did not covet the Imperial
throne; nor do I. I covet only peace and
rest. We have chosen seven hundred of the fairest
Jews to grace the triumph; and they shall not
walk in chains. They fought too well. They shall
all ride in the chariots of the pageants; but my
father, the Emperor, and I shall walk humbly
on foot divested of all war harness and make
thank offering to the gods of peace rather than
victory. Such humble rôle would suit not you,
my little Princess; but Rome never forgets even
a will to service. I’ll appoint your brother and
sister Drusilla a royal villa with dower by the
sea at Naples; and there if the gods favor me,
and my young officers do not carry you off, I shall
see you sometimes, Princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode quickly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Princess and her brother Agrippa stood
by the turret window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it for this she had risked her life? She
had reached Titus and grasped the prize, and
found it turn in her hands to Apples of Sodom
and the salt tears of the Dead Sea. She had
thrown love to the discard and was being told
to play the wanton with underlings, whom her
Herod pride scorned. She, the daughter of high
priests, back to Aaron, was to eat the crumbs
from Rome’s table, like the lapdogs, pets to be
fondled, abused, discarded—and then the grave!
And for this, she had rejected the children of
love in the garden called Paradise; the wine of
life drawn from a lover’s lips; the laughing glad
voice of many waters from the River of Life; the
golden light that was love—her spirit fell as it
had fallen in her delirious sleep; and she broke
in a storm of weeping in the arms of her weak
brother, no longer King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less than ten years saw Titus ascend that Imperial
throne for which he cared nought; but
the very year he ascended the throne came another
flood of flame in fiery river down Vesuvius
mountain burying the fair villas of Naples Bay,
and beneath that flood of death, unknown and
unfound, perished the last of the Herod line.</p>

foot of the right hand side; Damascus, the oldest
city of man, halfway up; Antioch, at the angle
turning westward, the playground and halfway
house, where merchant princes and conquering
emperors paused in their far journeyings from
Asia to Europe to take their pleasure and spend
their fortunes, whether of plunder or traffic; then
along the horizontal line leading from desert to
sea, Iconium and Philadelphia and Sardis; then
on the sea—Ephesus, whence one could sail to
Athens or Rome, to culture or power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the summer sea lay in painted crystal,
calm as glass, one could come down from any of
these cities, to fair harbors and take passage forward
on the great grain ships of Egypt or on
little sailing vessels; but when the equinoctial
storms came in September, or when war filled the
great grain ships with troops, travelers were
forced to follow the caravan route, and the khans
of all the cities were thronged with men of every
color and race under the sun. The poor camped
in goatskin tents outside the walls. They had
nothing to lose from plunder. The rich crowded
the city plazas and inns and public khans in the
throngs of a great annual fair; and the merchants
reaped their harvest in barter of little silver
images and amulets to protect from travelers’
perils, and in the sports of theater and hippodrome,
where the latest plays from Athens and
Rome were given; or lecturers from the Far East
disputed their mystic philosophies with the keen
wits of Athens and the cynics of Rome; or gladiators
fought; or captives in war were thrown
to the wild beasts with a chance for life and
freedom if they could vanquish tooth and claw
with naked hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sometimes bewail our modern civilization.
Go read of the nightly entertainments in these
cities of the Great Roman Road!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the evening of September 24, in
Iconium. Lystra and Derbe lay only a few hours
south, and there, by the curious trick Fate has of
interweaving lives, was the little Phyrygian lad,
Onesimus, with his father’s Damascus caravans,
beating southward for Damascus where he was
first captured by the robber bands of Galilee and
began his life of slavery, which took him first to
Cæsarea, then to Rome, then seven years later,
back over this very road where he rescued victims
from crime as he had been rescued by Paul in
Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city was thronged. Caravans returning
from Ephesus had money to spend. Travelers
from the Asian Desert going on to Ephesus wandered
dazed amid the booths and shops, famed
for their Tyrian purple damasks and gold-thread
curtains and rugs of goat hair silky as finest fur.
The plaza was a living mass of humanity clothed
in brightest colors milling in endless circlings
round the musicians under the central trees, who
were paid by the city to give free entertainment
to all visitors. The balconies of houses overhanging
the city square began to open shutters;
and dark eyes were seen above answering lovers’
signals below; but on the sill of one deep casement
sat a girl alone. A rabble had gathered
round a speaker in the city square. The speaker
was short of stature, with thighs that had been
lamed in war or accident, but he was clad in the
black silk cloak of a man of distinction, and
though his receding hair showed premature care,
his forehead reflected the white light of an
æsthetic; and as he declaimed, his eyes lighted
up with a strange fire of faith. Near the speaker
lounged a richly dressed, stout, prosperous Greek
of the merchant class. He was not listening. He
was watching with amused cynicism the changing
concentrated expression of the girl’s intent
face in the balcony above. The man twisted at
the great emerald signet ring on his little finger.
He clanked the sword dangling in its jeweled
scabbard against the heel of his red morocco
high boots. He stuck his thumbs in the gold sash
belting his sky-blue silk jacket. Then he stroked
his oiled curls projecting from the gold-and-blue
turban cap. The girl’s eyes never once glanced
his way. They were riveted as on a life and death
messenger towards the little deformed orator
round whom larger crowds were now pressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout, middle-aged Greek dandy flushed
angrily and stepped sharply up to the house door
below the balcony. He lifted the brass knocker
and rapped loudly. The knocker was a great
Roman eagle. The door was opened by a middle-aged
woman, clad in rich purple silk, and he
was led to an inner court open to the sky in the
middle of the house. A fountain played in the
center of the court, and over the railing of the
stone stairs leading to the chambers off the upper
balcony clung vines and blooming flowers scenting
the night air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now, my son, Thamyris?” smiled the
middle-aged woman, showing teeth white as pearls
between painted lips, and shaking the black jeweled
pendants in her ears so they seemed part of
the curls framing her ivory face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not son—yet,” answered the man irritably,
“unless your daughter Thecla has eyes for her
lover rather than that Jewish babbler ranting in
the square there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pest on these wandering synagogue ranters,
who upset our daughters’ beliefs in the old gods.”
The woman’s smile was hard as marble. “She has
not moved from that window for three nights
since the fellow strayed into Iconium and began
speaking in the square! I can do nothing with
her. I like not her silence, Thamyris! I would
she stormed; but she sits silent as stone—listening,
listening to that babbler! Who is he? A
girl never knows herself till a man teaches her
what love is. Can’t you get rid of him?” And
the hard laugh of the girl’s mother had a sinister
knowledge that was not of youth, as she shot a
glance at the middle-aged man, which he read
without words. “I want my daughter married.
She is eighteen summers this night. She will
marry as I bid her, or go to the temple gods and
take her fate. I will have no daughter of eighteen
summers betraying my years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laughed; but he laughed with angry
red flush. He flung himself down on the bench.
“And yet, my Mother, eighteen summers wed to
fifty make not for peace to the man unless the
maid come willingly. You ask—who is he? I
know not, except that he has changed his name
from Saul to Paul, follows the new sect of that
Christus crucified in Jerusalem and boasts he
is a Roman citizen, else we could have him crucified,
too, for creating disorder by blaspheming
against Greek gods. All I know is—he is a fool.
When he came here first and worked miracles
of healing, the people would have offered sacrifices
to him as to a god—he could have grown
rich from the gifts of one caravan. I would have
pushed him, myself, for the profit in it, if he
hadn’t played the fool and backed away from
the rabble’s worship and gifts; but when the people
were ready to crown him with garlands and
make offerings of beasts and jewels and gold, he
had to cry out he was only a man and stop them;
and now the rabble are ready to stone him as a
pious fraud. I could leave him to the rabble
but I fear the damage is done—he has chilled
Thecla’s love for me; and I’ll have no unwilling
bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you get rid of him?” insistently repeated
the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try. I can lodge a complaint and have
him imprisoned for causing disorder; but he is
Roman citizen—more than that, I dare not do—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than that I will do,” added the mother
harshly. “Unless she gives you your word this
night, I turn her from my door into the streets.
There you can seize her and carry her to your
own house, Thamyris; or the city magistrate will
seize her for wandering the streets without the
badge of a courtesan on her forehead and have
her burned at the faggots. Little headstrong
fool! Does she think to change our Greek customs
for a puny whim? I have given her dower
to make a princess rich; and you have given her
gifts of an empress; and she sits listening to that
beggarly babbler, whom no one knows, stone to
her blood mother’s commands and cold as a Venus
in snow to her lover. Go to her! Plead not!
Command! Do as you will! My ears are deaf!
A girl denying her lover in Iconium would last
long as a gazelle baited by hounds—Pah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The middle-aged, stout, heavy lover went bounding
up the balcony steps fast as his fat calves and
stiff knees would carry him. He drew aside the
silk portières hanging across the daughter’s apartment
and advanced across the room a little
breathless. The girl turned her head but did not
speak. Thereupon, something he had not reckoned
smote his courage cold. It was the love
he had for the fair child in the window seat. He
could not touch her. He could not risk turning
love to indifference, or indifference to hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now, my little bride,” he said gallantly
drawing something from his gold sash, “here are
some gifts I purchased to-day from the Damascus
caravans—emerald earrings set in Damascus gold
wrought fine as a spider web, and a little silver
mirror from an Arab merchant, which shall show
your face fairer than Venus’ eyelids penciled for
the dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had meant to lay the gifts in her lap and
take her thanks in an embrace; but somehow he
could only open the little cases and shove them
awkwardly along the stone window sill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s long-lashed eyes filled with tears.
She smiled sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor dear Thamyris,” she said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not poor,” he interrupted harshly, “nor dear,
either, unless I am dear to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Thamyris—if these gifts are to buy my
love, I cannot take them. I would be cheating
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on the window sill beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not gifts to buy your love. They
are tokens of my love,” he said, toying with the
gold tassel of her sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if they are tokens of your love, I am
cheating you, dear Thamyris; for I cannot give
you love in return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am no huckster,” he urged, flushing angrily.
“They are the free gift of a free Greek. I ask
no love in return. I only ask that you become
my bride and let me teach you love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mutely shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put them on,” he ordered abruptly. “Your
mother has pledged you to me. You are mine;
but I will not claim you till you come willingly
to my arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you command me, I put them on.
I must obey you as long as I remain in my mother’s
house.” She fastened the filigree clasps to her
ears and thrust the silver mirror in her sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man sat in the window studying her. The
rabble round the speaker in the square below
was growing noisier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thecla,” asked the man abruptly. “Is it that
you love some one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned her full gaze upon him. Her
eyes were deep blue. Her lashes were long and
black and curling. Her brows were arches penciled
fine as if done by an artist; and her whole
face glowed with a radiance as of sun dawn in
spring. Her breathing quickened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Thamyris, I love some one else; but you
can never understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this beggarly babbler, Paul, with the
changing names and magic?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. Her glance dropped. “Not
Paul. That is why I said you would never understand.
It is Paul’s Master—the Christ—I
love—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man broke in a loud impatient laugh.
“Why, child, He’s dead! He was crucified before
you were born! You love a shadow—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not dead,” she answered simply. “That
is why I said you would never understand. He
is the Christ of Love and Light and Life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But will love for a myth, who was crucified
by His own countrymen, keep you from marrying
a living man and lover? Does your Paul preacher
down there teach men and maids not to marry?
That is blasphemy, my Thecla! It proves the
gods made a mistake in the way they made us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man almost shouted his relief. He had
risen and was pacing the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, love for the Christ would not keep me
from marrying living man; and Paul does not
teach that. He teaches that the sin of sins is
cheating love; and that is what I would be doing
if I married you, Thamyris, and did not love
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man came forward to the window and
gazed down in the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll risk your not loving me,” he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face darkened. He thrust his hands
in his gold sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thecla, what is this new madness setting all
the Greek cities of Asia by the ears? I am reasonable.
I would learn; but I am a man; and
I am flesh and blood. You are pledged to me.
I can claim you. You say I can never understand.
Let us reason this out. Granted I can’t
understand—what does Paul teach, tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Gospel of Youth and Gladness—” she
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t claim Youth, but if you will marry me,
I can Gladness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that the dead must bury their dead; and
that you can’t put new wine in old bottles,” she
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face flushed and darkened. “Go
on,” he said, “you are apt pupil for this deceiver!
Try walking in the streets alone to-night and I’ll
warrant an old bottle would be good protection
for new wine gone to a girl’s head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That money is the root of evil—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But very useful to spoiled brides,” he added
bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That children born of such union as you would
force on me have teeth set on edge because their
fathers have eaten sour grapes; that we must
level up, not down; that the road to happiness
is narrow as a razor; and that if we find the great
pearl called love, we must not cast it before swine;
and that is what I would be doing with your
love—Thamyris—if I took it and gave none in
return. I would be the Circe of your pagan
gods turning your beautiful love into a thing for
swine—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the growing dusk she could not see his face,
but she felt the waves of his deep anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once more and for the last time, I ask you—is
it yes or no, Thecla?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Thamyris,” she pleaded, rising and laying
her hand on his arm, “it must be no for your
own sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung her hand from his arm and strode
heavily down the stairs of the inner court. The
mother rose from the stone bench by the fountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant drew his sword from his scabbard.
“I must get this arch-deceiver put away.
I’ll have the impostor whipped from the city for
creating riots. He has turned her head,” and
he flung through the street doorway to the
crowded city square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thecla heard what he said from where she sat
sadly down on the stone sill of the upper balcony.
“He that loveth father or mother more
than me is not worthy of me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she repeated,
“and he that taketh not his cross and followeth
after me, is not worthy of me; and he that
findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth
life for my sake should find it”—and she saw as
in a trance, the red flowers dancing above the
fountains of the city square, the snowy mountains
like opal gems in the moonlight encircling
the little city, the lake with its myriad pleasure
boats alight with lanterns, where the mountain
torrents fed the great water pool of the city—when
the trance was broken by a wild halloo in
the city square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little lame speaker was backing away from
the menacing rabble now milling round him with
hisses of ridicule. Two rough fellows to rear
had picked up stones and hurled them. Rocks,
rained down from a claque to rear, pushed those
forward into a riot. The preacher raised his
arm to screen his face. A rock had struck him.
She saw the blood gush from his face. He fell—then
all was mingled in the confusion of the people
running for cover to the booths and shops,
when a pound of iron-shod hoofs came over the
cobblestones. A Roman Legion swept into the
square, encircled the fallen form of the speaker,
threw him across the saddle in front of the captain,
and wheeled towards the Roman prison on
the far side of the plaza. As the crowd came
out again from the shops, she caught a glimpse
of Thamyris thrusting his sword back in its jeweled
scabbard glancing up towards her seat in the
window. She drew back sickened in soul and
heavy-hearted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As though treachery would win love,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mother stood in the curtained entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you given Thamyris his answer?” the
woman demanded harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” answered the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman clapped her hands for a servant.
A black woman came noiselessly in and lighted
the brass chandelier with a long taper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stood as still and white as death under
the light. The mother read the answer in the
white face, and her own face became white and
hard as stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—go—from—this house,” she slowly
pronounced, “and never darken its doors again
till you are wedded wife of Thamyris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl picked up her black cloak from the
couch she was never to see again, threw it over
her shoulders and passed silently down the courtyard
stairs, and out to the night street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hard marble face of the mother broke in a
harsh cunning laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now—Thamyris,” was all she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black woman withdrew with a shiver and
followed her young mistress down the stairs. As
she heard the street door shut twice, the mother
laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence of midnight with a chill of
the mountain snows fell on the little city where
East and West met on the Great Roman
Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the two cloaked women passed through
the outer door to the darkened and deserted
square, they were followed by three silent figures—two
of them rude fellows, who had thrown
the rocks at the speaker and fomented the riot
of the throngs listening forward, the third with
a blue-and-gold turban cap, a blue-silk jacket and
a sword in his gold sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow,” the third ordered. “When they run
for the dark lanes, seize them. Clap your hands
over their faces so they cannot scream! Do what
you like with the black woman—she is yours;
but I am to rescue the maid. See you hurt her
not, but frighten her well, and when I strike at
you with my sword, take to your heels. Avoid
the Roman watchman! This must not be known!
Come to my warerooms for your reward to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Roman watchman with brass lantern
on arm was pacing the center of the square, and
to him the two women hastened. The three men
following stealthily in the shadows of the buildings
round the square saw them pause and speak
to the Roman. There was parley of some kind.
The Roman soldier seemed to be hesitating! He
had laughed loudly at first. Now he was in doubt
and hesitating. The woman with the white face
had thrown back her cloak, lifted her hands and
was unfastening her earrings. She placed them
in the Roman’s hands. He had liftened his brass
lantern and was examining the proffered jewels.
He lifted his bugle and blew a shrill whistle. Half
a dozen Roman soldiers came running from the
prison side of the city square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three spies dodged into a darkened lane
between streets. When they emerged on the city
square again, stealthily glancing in all directions,
there was not a sign of Roman watchman, soldiers,
women. Thamyris drew his sword in a
blind fury of balked passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clowns—blackguards,” he stamped. “You
were too slow! We have lost them,” and he
struck in impotent rage at his terrified tools.
They obeyed his injunction of but a moment before
and took to their heels down the dark
lanes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The turnkey of the prison sat nodding over a
tankard of wine in a little room off the entrance
from the square. A Roman watchman had
roused him and the two were examining, by the
light of the soldier’s brass lantern, a pair of
emerald earrings set in Damascus filigree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good jewels—not false—by Jupiter—ten
years’ wages; and what do you say she wants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see the wounded teacher rescued from
the mob to-night; but she has disobeyed her
mother, refused to go to her affianced husband,
and been turned out in the streets as a courtesan.
She refuses to wear a courtesan’s red band round
her brow; and by Iconium law, she will be burned
at the stake for that. These independent cities
on the Roman Road have their own laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that to us? The jewels are good!
Take her to the prisoner’s cell; but he is a Roman
citizen. He must not be harmed without trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watchman went back to the cloaked figures
in the corridor. He led them without a word
down the long passageway lighted dimly by iron
candles with flaming pine knots. Before one cell
tramped another Roman soldier. The watchman
spoke to the guard in a low voice. He came back
to the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says—what will you give him to let you
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thecla drew a silver mirror from her girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watchman went back to the guard. Again,
there was a conference under the light of the
pine faggot in the iron clamp against the stone
wall. The silver mirror was being examined.
The watchman returned to the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says after you have seen him—what will
you do? We Romans interfere not with Grecian
laws in the independent cities. He does not want
trouble over this. What will you do afterwards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him,” answered the Grecian girl, “I shall
deliver myself to the Greek magistrate to-morrow
morning to be burned in the hippodrome for disobeying
my mother, and refusing to marry the
man to whom she sold me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard heard the answer, put the great
key in the cell lock and pushed open the creaking
door. The two women passed in and the door
locked behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they could see nothing by the
smoky light of the pine knot in the iron clamp
of the wall except the silver beam of the moonlight
breaking the dark through a casement window
so deep you could only see the night sky
outside as through a long high tube. There was
the sound of breathing, and a man’s figure lay
on a cot against the wall, with one arm and
one foot padlocked to a staple in the stones. His
head was pillowed on a folded black cloak and
his forehead bound in a white cloth, where the
rocks of the rioters had struck him, but the moonlight
falling on his face and hands showed a curious
luminous radiance and white peace. At first
the Greek girl thought he was dead and her knees
gave under her. Then, she heard his breathing
and knew that he slept and was dreaming happy
dreams, as children dream in peace, for the white
face smiled in its sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Greek girl’s eyes closed and her lips moved
in prayer. Yet she hardly knew how or to whom
to pray; for in the temples of Iconium there were
only statues of the goddess Venus, or Diana, or
the Roman emperors; and she had never before
prayed to an Unknown, Invisible God. Her serving
woman fell to her knees and began to wail
aloud, swaying her body to and fro after the
manner of the Blacks. When Thecla opened
her eyes from an almost inarticulate prayer, she
saw the prisoner sitting up on his cot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child—how came—you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him in a few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you counted the cost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No cost can be too great,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled quietly as though he had not been
mobbed and stoned by a riotous rabble but a few
hours before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, child, no cost can be too great; for no
one can leave father or mother, or brother or
sister to join the Glad Kingdom but the reward
shall be a hundredfold, both here and hereafter.
The cost is but the trifling price we pay to pass
through the portals to the Unseen Kingdom,
whether here or hereafter; but why came you
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be baptized into that Kingdom before they
whip you from the city to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bid your serving woman bring me the jar of
drinking water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kneeled at his feet. He dipped his finger
in the jar and marked the sign of the Cross on
her brow. “I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit into the
service of the Glad Kingdom both here and hereafter,
now and forever more,” he said. “Bid
your woman hand me the bread and the cup of
wine. Quaff now the Loving Cup with me, child!”
He handed her a broken piece of bread. “In as
oft as you do this, you do it in remembrance of
the Crucified One’s Last Supper with His Loved
Ones; but remember always, child—it is not the
Doleful Supper, which these children of the Adversary
say; it is the Loving Cup to commemorate
His translation to the One and Only God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in the darkened prison of Iconium between
midnight and dawn, the first woman martyr to
the new faith was baptized into the Unseen Kingdom
and quaffed the Loving Cup to her Lord;
and in the little modern city of Konieh, a thousand
legends of Thecla, some true, some fanciful,
are told among the mountain folk to this day.
Sometimes, they have it, that the faggots were
kindled in the Iconium Theater and the wild beast
tournament held in Antioch; but each city marking
the crumbling stones of the Old Roman Road
has its own legend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thecla rose from her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Master,” she said, “how can I serve the
Kingdom if I am to be burned to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That—I know not. God will lead you. If
you are burned to-morrow, ’twill be but the fiery
gate to the Unseen Kingdom and service there. If
you are not burned, God will lead you to service
here. I shall be whipped from the city at day
dawn and go to Timothy, a child in years like
yourself, at Derbe and Lystra; but at Antioch
is the Brotherhood, where holy men and women
plan our warfare against the Adversary—the
World, the Flesh and the Devil; but hard by
Antioch are the Gardens of Daphne, where many
maids like you are forced to barter love for carnal
gain. Go to them, child! You have been rescued!
Rescue them! How, I know not. God will lead
you and my prayers will follow you—a cloud of
light to fore—follow it—a screen of protection
behind—look not back—but press gladly forward
to the high calling of a warrior for the Christ; and
the Lord bless you and keep you in the inmost
sanctuary of His Grace and Gladness! He shall
renew your flesh as a little child’s and keep in your
heart an eternal youth, long as you drink of the
Living Waters of Life! Never repine! Never
envy! Go forth rejoicing always! Rejoice, rejoice,
child, again I say rejoice! For our suffering
is but as idle passing dream, and we shall awaken
to Eternal Day.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>All Iconium was agog. As far as it is possible
to set down definite dates in this era, it was about
46 A.D.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, an impostor, who followed the Christus
of the Jews, had been whipped from the city at day
dawn for contempt towards the gods of Rome and
Greece. The mob had given over pursuing when he
fell senseless outside the walls of the city. Then,
an overland caravan from Rome had come along
the road headed for Antioch; and in the caravan
was the famous and rich lady Trefina, cousin of
the Emperor of Rome, bound to spend the winter
season in the pleasure gardens of Daphne; and
the merchant princes of Iconium were planning a
great fête to entertain these visitors and unlock
their fat purses. It was bruited about that a
Greek girl, a convert to the Christian disturber,
was to be thrown to the wild beasts in the theater
that night. Some said her crime was sacrilege.
Others said she was a woman of the streets, who
refused to wear the red cord that was badge of
her calling, and had bribed the guards of the
prison to go in and corrupt the very prisoners
under the magistrate’s nose. Others again
averred she had refused to obey her mother and
run away from the husband, who had bought her.
And all Iconium, high and low, was agog to see
the great fête in the theater that night for the
Lady Trefina, cousin of the Emperor, who had but
lost her daughter and was in such dejection that
the citizens were determined to win her favor by
an exhibition that would dispel her weariness of
all living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the fat Greek merchant, Thamyris,
knocked on the door of the house in the city
square; and again the middle-aged woman opened
the door and drew him hurriedly in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man threw himself on the stone bench with
a groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard the magistrate’s sentence for
to-night?” he asked; and the tears streamed down
his cheeks. “I have tried to see her all day. I
have offered an emperor’s ransom to save her; but
the coming of the Lady Trefina from Rome has
fixed the Roman Commander in his purpose and
he will not budge. They blame my slaves for
fomenting the riot last night. They despise us
Greeks! They will tear us to pieces with bloody
hands and throw us to the beasts if we but stir to
save her. My slaves have betrayed me! They
say I have been caught in my own trick—” the
merchant broke in heavy heart-shattering sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother stood surveying him with unutterable
hard scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unmanly fool!” she taunted. “I thank the
gods you are to be no son of mine! Why did you
not seize her and force her to your will, when she
passed through the door as we planned? Blunderer!
Bungler! To let a wisp of a maid slip
through your fumble fingers like a jewel to mud!
Not thus did my Lord win me! He stole me from
the hills of Phrygia, and broke me to his will; and
if I were a man, would I pause for this little fool’s
tears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye; and you poisoned your Lord for a night’s
pastime, and took his fortune and would sell your
daughter to me to play wanton again for another
rich husband! Think you I would love Thecla if
she had been such as you?” and the wretched man
broke again into terrible sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second, the incarnate fury standing above
the unguarded man could not speak; and when she
spoke, it was in the hiss of a serpent about to
strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say you—that—to me?” she demanded.
“Know you not I could denounce you to the
Romans to-night as the corrupter of my daughter
and the cause of all this riot to gain your ends?
Say—you—that—to me? Take back what you
said—fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say—that—to you!” The man sprang to his
feet and seized her by the throat. “Yes—that—and
that—and that,” he stabbed her at each word,
flung her on the tessellated pavement, and not
pausing to see whether she were living or dead,
dashed through the doorway to the street and
ran through the deserted city for the theater,
where all Iconium had thronged. He did not
notice his sky-blue jacket was spattered with blood.
He had flung his bloody dagger from him as he
ran. He was a madman. He knew not whether
the roar he heard were in his own bursting brain,
or from the tier on tier of stone seats in the open
theater, where all Iconium was stamping their
impatience and shouting for the performance to
begin. He tossed the guard at the gate a gold
coin; and the Roman laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was the maid’s lover,” said the Roman;
and Thamyris vaulted the stone stairs to the highest
seat, where he could see both audience and
arena. The trumpets were blowing. Riders on
horses with ribbons and tassels were prancing
round the arena. The great lady Trefina from
Rome was entering the royal box, for pipes and
bugles and trumpets blew a blast; and the drums
beat for the stone doors to lift and admit the wild
beasts to the sanded circle below the spectators.
First came a lioness lashing her tail from side to
side; but the spectators hissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too full-fed,” the Greek merchant heard a
Roman soldier behind him saying. “If we had
known the Lady Trefina was to be here to-night,
we could have starved the beast so she’d fight.
I’d say—let in her cubs! Stab one of her cubs,
and she’ll liven up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fanfare of trumpets and pipes blew
again to drown the shrieks of the victim—a door
on the opposite side of the arena lifted and a
horseman rode in with a naked girl across his
saddle pummel. He spurred his horse to a frantic
gallop five times around the arena. The
audience rose and cheered to the echo. The Lady
Trefina in the royal enclosure was seen to sink
back and drop her veil at the sight of the entertainment
that had been provided in her honor;
but the horseman having speeded round and round
the arena now approached the dazed lioness,
reached over, and, with his long whip, struck the
crouching creature a stinging cut, and dropped
the naked form across his saddle pummel not a
stone’s throw from the enraged beast. The
trumpets blew till the echo rang amid the temple
columns encircling the arena, and the spectators
went mad in a blood lust of shouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fall had loosened the victim’s hair. It fell
in great black coils almost to her feet, and beneath
her hair could be seen her nude form pink as a
shell or sun dawn. A terrible silence fell. The
spectators held their breath. The trumpets had
silenced to be ready for a blast to drown any cry
of anguish. The naked Greek girl had lighted
agile as a bird on her feet, and she moved not so
much as a hair’s breadth from the crouching
lioness now snarling and lashing head and tail
from side to side. Her flesh looked fresh as a
little child’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little fool! Why doesn’t she fight, or run!”
demanded the Roman beside Thamyris. The
Greek merchant sank heavily where he sat and
hid his face in his hands. He wanted to shout her
name, but had the coward’s protective presence
of mind to know a shout would raise uproar and
enrage the lioness. She was perishing and he, the
real murderer, was watching her perish. Sweat
of anguish stood out on his body in hot drops as
of blood. What was it she had said—the sin of
sins was cheating love?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence in the vast audience had grown so
tense he could hear the snarl of the lioness, the
lash of its tail on the sand, the breathing of the
audience as if spellbound and cowed. He peered
through his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is an enchantress and ought to be burned,”
muttered a Jewish priest. “Paul hath bewitched
the maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lioness had crouched but it had not sprung.
It was advancing with its red angry eyes on the
motionless, naked form. The girl did not move.
The beast paused. The girl stretched out her
hand. The lioness ceased lashing its tail angrily
and tossing its head from side to side. It was
creeping on her as a cat creeps on a bird. She
stooped and all her hair fell about and hid her
nakedness. The great cat came on but it did not
strike nor spring. Its eyes were on the Greek
girl’s, and the girl’s eyes were on its eyes. It
raised its head. She did not move her outstretched
hand. It sniffed her hand and dropped
its head to her feet. She slowly stooped and laid
her hand on its head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the silence stretched so tense that a
shuffle of feet and whispers brought angry looks
from neighbors on the seats. Slowly, gently, with
the caress of a mother for her young, the Greek
girl was stroking the head of the beast between
its ears. It stooped and licked her feet and lay
down as if in the presence of a friend recognized,
where it had expected foe. On bended knee, the
girl stooped, caressing the beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Trefina in the royal enclosure had
lifted her veil and was leaning forward. The
commandant was seen to lean across to her, and
she rose and threw a laurel wreath into the arena.
The horseman came spurring back and snatched
the girl to his saddle. Other horsemen came galloping
with long lances and drove the now terrified
lioness back through the stone portal. All
Iconium rose to its feet on the stone benches and
shouted salvos of frantic applause; but the cries
were mingled. Some shouted, “Saved—Saved!”
others hissed and shouted back “More—More.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blood lust felt that it had somehow been
cheated of its full glut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the center of the arena stood a tall flagpole
with the Roman eagle in brass on the tip. The
horseman with the naked girl now circled this in
frantic gallops. Reining his horse so suddenly
that it reared on its haunches, he now leaped off
with the girl in his arms. He placed the laurel
wreath on her forehead. With such a broad belt
as men use to girth chariot teams, he now strapped
the victim by the waist to the pole. Iconium knew
what was coming and began to roar in an earthquake
of applause. Never did this Greek city on
the Great Roman Road fail of entertainment for
royal visitors. After all, the quick victory of the
girl over the beast was not to cheat their lust for
horrors. Black slaves were piling faggots and
straw about the pole. Others were emptying great
vats of water in a lake about the pile to prevent
the fire leaping across the sands to the seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thamyris sank from the upper bench, where he
sat, a crumpled heap of blood-spattered blue silk
with gold sash, to the stone space behind the
next tier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead,” said the Roman standing behind him.
“These Greeks are all soft at pith. Would
Roman die of love for a mistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fanfare of trumpets was blowing again to
drown cries of anguish; and in the crash of drum
and bugle and trumpet, another crash was not
heeded. The opal peaks no longer swam in silver
moonlight. A black squall was coming down from
the mountains and the commandant was seen
signaling the attendants to hasten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oil was poured on the faggots and straw, and
a torch held to the far edge near the pools of
water. The flame shot up, illumining the dark
bloodthirsty faces, tier on tier of seats to mid-heaven.
Again the crash of trumpets! The white
figure of the victim was seen to raise her hands as
if to Heaven and whether from the flame or the
lightning of the gathering storm, her face shone
radiant and fearless as dawn. Clouds of dust and
sand blew through the arena in a tornado. Neighbor
could not see neighbor on the stone seats and
all the assembly began drawing cloaks over heads
to protect them from the stifle of dust till the gust
had passed. There was a terrible and sudden lull,
when sand and rain came down in a deluge. Then
the lightning bolts came—came in forks, and
spears, and javelins of dazzling blinding light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a reverberating crash that rocked
the templed columns of the theater as though they
had been reeds in a wind. Women rose with
screams. Men dashed up in panic. Was the
earthquake feared more in the cities of the Roman
Road than vengeance of God or man? A sharp
ricocheting splintering as of the theater falling,
and the lightning struck—struck the brass-tipped
pole in the middle of the arena and the deluge
burst from mid-heaven in rods of rain—torrential
rains in a hurricane of wind and lightning. The
pole fell. Some one shouted that the Lady
Trefina had fainted. The Roman, who had stood
above Thamyris’ dead body, saw an attendant run
across the arena through the flashes of lurid lightning,
snatch an unconscious white prone figure
from the pile of quenched faggots, and dash to the
royal enclosure of the Lady Trefina with the naked
Greek girl over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest was lost in the darkness and the deluge
of rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Iconium awakened to cloudless skies the
next morning, the city of the Roman Road was
again agog with gossip. Had the Greek maid perished
of the lightning stroke, or the fire? Had
any one seen her body? No one knew. The great
fête had ended in fiasco, and the commandant was
in testy mood not to be questioned. Certainly one
rumor proved true—Thamyris was dead; but
whether he had died of grief for the loss of his
promised bride, or been stabbed in a brawl on the
upper tier of seats, newsmongers did not know;
for his body had been found all blood-spattered
from blue jacket to silken breeches. Thecla’s
mother could not be seen; for she was ill abed of
heartbreak. And certainly, the Lady Trefina
from Rome had departed at day dawn ill pleased
with the fête; for she had not waited for the caravan.
She had gone ahead at break of day in a
litter chair with no attendant but the Roman Commander,
a Greek page boy, who looked like a girl,
mounted on a fleet horse, and an old colored
woman bent astride over a mule, hanging to the
saddle pummel as though she were frightened out
of her wits.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The record of Thecla must now jump forward
some twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Roman Road on two sides of a square
from Ephesus east to Antioch and from Antioch
south to Jerusalem to this day has legends of
what happened to her in these years. Some said
she had escaped with the Lady Trefina dressed
as a page boy. Others said she had joined Paul
and Timothy at Derbe and Lystra. Others knew
she had lived hidden in caves between Antioch and
Daphne Gardens. About all that is authentic
that can be gathered of this period is that the
Lady Trefina adopted her in place of the dead
daughter and left her a substantial fortune. Paul
had gone to Rome, where Nero had beheaded him
when he could not crucify a Roman citizen. Peter
had come up from Babylon to take Paul’s place in
Rome, hurrying over the same Roman Road from
the Desert of the East and had been crucified in
Rome, because he was not a Roman citizen. Nero,
himself, had suicided. From Antioch to Damascus
and Jerusalem, the Roman Road was now
yearly packed with Imperial troops, for Titus, the
Emperor Vespasian’s son, had taken the Holy
City, and, except for the Herod Towers on the
west, left not a stone standing of the Jewish capital.
The Christian Sect, though hated by the
Jews, had been driven by the war from Antioch
to Ephesus, where they gathered strength each
day; and in an era of universal persecution and
massacre, Thecla was forgotten. She was now
only one of countless martyrs to a despised faith;
and the faith suffered less on the Roman Road
than in the Imperial City or Judea, because these
Greek trade cities of Asia Minor had been granted
independent laws, provided they kept fealty to
Rome. The only danger to them was the
Emperor worship, which Rome had set up in every
Greek temple—statues of Roman conquerors, side
by side with Greek deities for worship and homage
to unify the Empire. Some philosophers declared
openly this was the worship of the Beast foretold
in prophecy of Greek sibyl and Hebrew seer.
Others said the name in whispers and bided their
time for Rome’s fall from a pinnacle of intoxicated
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again it was the month of September. Grapes
hung heavy on the vineyards lining the road. The
olive groves alone shone brilliant green in the
drought. The cactus hedges stood withered and
gaunt, like ragged ghosts flinging wild arms out
in the blue haze of late summer. On the broad
Roman Road the dust was a yellow curse to man
and beast, but at dusk and dawn it was a crimson
glory against an amber skyline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two travelers coming up from Jerusalem to
Antioch had been driven off their course by the
press of troops going back to Rome after the fall
of Jerusalem. One was mounted on a huge,
grizzled camel in trappings of silver, with tassels
and buckles of brass in the Roman eagle; but he
was no Roman. He was a Greek Hebrew, clad
all in white, with a sword to the gold cord round
his neck, and he wore the long flowing white beard
of philosopher, or doctor of the laws. The other
rode a jaded horse and was a younger man, near
the thirties or forties in age, pure Greek, with blue
eyes and golden curled hair cut short to his neck.
He, too, was clad in white cloak with sword scabbard
hanging from the gold cord round his neck;
and a pack of sumptuary mules and camels in
charge of servants followed behind with tents and
baggage. Failing to make way through the press
of Roman legions on the road to Damascus, the
travelers had skirted off to the left down by the
sea path; but there, too, their progress was impeded
by the departing troops. At Cæsarea, they
could get quarters in neither khan nor inn, and
had to camp outside the city wall. When they
sought to take ship for Ephesus, they found decks
and holds crammed, yes, crammed with the returning
victorious legions; and the plunder every man
carried was a king’s ransom. There were priceless
Damascus hangings woven in gold thread
taken from the Temple. Some of the soldiers had
cast off their hot metal armor and swathed themselves
in these gorgeous curtains and tapestries,
and reeled sodden drunk from the stone quay back
and forward to the taverns. Others carried
plunder of gold coin and gold ornaments rifled
from the houses of the destroyed city openly in
pouches round their waist, and could be seen in
the port streets dicing their gold away at a cheaper
rate than a pound of gold for a grain of wheat,
or an ounce of silver for a roll of goat’s cheese;
and as it was the wine press season in Palestine
and the new wine was heady and raw, the intoxicated
soldiers drank more freely of the wine than
the water, which had been poisoned by the bodies
of the dead thrown into wells and pools. Men
could be seen draining a deep tankard at one quaff,
then throwing away the gold or silver cup, which
came from the Temple, and stretching themselves
out to sleep off their debauch, by roadside or in
city gutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two travelers stood on the broad breakwater,
that ran out in a circle to the sea, and
watched the captive Hebrews embarking for
Rome. There were seven hundred, all over seventeen
in years and under thirty—in the prime
of manhood’s beauty, to grace the Triumph in the
Imperial City. All other captives, men, women,
children, were being sold into slavery to the Arabs
and Egyptians for less than the price of a dog. A
few thousand older than thirty were being kept
for the gladiatorial combats that nightly entertained
the Roman Legions in the hippodrome.
Some women and aged men—it is recorded about
two thousand—who could not bring a price as
slaves—were being reserved to be thrown to the
wild beasts between the acts of the gladiatorial
fights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Greek travelers stood watching the
embarkation from the quay. Suddenly there was
a great outcry of “Make way—make way—for
King Agrippa”; and the last of the Herod line—a
man in middle age—passed down the gangway,
bent, broken, and gray of hair on his brow. He
was accompanied by the Princess Bernice in litter
chair or palanquin, but little did her pale face
show the regal pride of the Herods, who had ruled
Judea for a century. She lay back in her chair
indifferent to the remarks of the gaping loungers,
weary of life, with the cold hardness in her dark-ringed
black eyes of one who has lost the prize
and slain all hope in her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Greek onlooker gave a start forward.
The older bearded man laid a hand on
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the dead bury their dead—my Onesimus!
If souls refuse rebirth into a new life and will
remain in their own dungeons, they can but die!
New wine in new bottles, son; for the new wine
has burst the old bottles in the glad wine of a new
life for the ages to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible to get passage by sea to
Ephesus; so the next morning, they resumed their
journey along the sea road toward Antioch. It
is unnecessary to trace the progress forward of
that journey. Every stopping place was sacred
to the past and to the future for all time—Tyre
and Sidon and Carmel, whose glories had departed
with memories of Elijah and Jonah and
Solomon and Christ; then Seleucia, the port leading
through mountain pass to Antioch; but here,
while war had not left desolation, so many of the
Roman officers had come up to pass the winter in
rest and pleasure that the Greek travelers were
again forced to camp outside the city walls and
send their beasts and servants into one of the
public khans, where they would have shelter when
the autumn rains broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desert and mountain clans had done as
they are doing to-day and have done since time
began—as the snows and rains of the upper mountains
began to fall, they had driven their herds
down to the plains to pasture for the winter or
find sale to the Roman buyers. A yellow tent city
of woven camels’ hair dotted the plains outside the
city walls of white marble and gray stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having left guard at their tent, the two Greek
travelers entered the city gates to search for an
evening meal at one of the public inns. They
found themselves seated at table in the courtyard
of an inn near the city gate, much frequented by
the sheiks of the hill and desert tribes with the
herds outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motley rude fellows sat cheek by jowl with
Arab sheiks and heads of mountain clans and the
rough riff-raff element that lives by its wits in
every great city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger man had set down his tankard of
goats’ milk and turned to his aged companion:
“My Apollos,” he said, “why was I directed to
leave Babylonia and to come on to Ephesus? I
had taken up the work of Peter when he went to
Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His aged bearded companion gazed absently, as
if far back and far forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have Peter’s Epistles to the Greek
Churches of Asia?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had them copied for all the Greek
Churches of Asia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Recall you where he admonished—‘Love the
brotherhood—fear God—honor the King—for
the time for me to lay aside my body is now
rapidly drawing near?’ He foreknew his own
translation to the Upper Kingdom. Matthew and
Luke and Mark have gone to Egypt. Thomas
has passed to the beyond in Persia. John, only,
is left among the Greeks and he is banished to
Patmos. I have been forbidden Rome since Paul’s
death and must to Crete. On you must fall the
joy of directing the Greek cities of the Roman
Road. You must be bishop of Ephesus—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—bishop? I am not even an elder. Have
you forgotten all Grecian Asia knows I was a
runaway slave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Onesimus—I have not forgotten; and because
of what the gracious help of God has done
for you, would I see you bishop to encourage other
youth to join our warfare. We are a brotherhood
militant, and who but youth for fighting ranks!
New wine in old bottles bursts the worn goatskins.
New wine of life for new age, son, old heads for
guidance and wisdom; but ours is the good news
of youth and gladness; and when our bodies wax
old as a garment, we must lay them off and move
on to eternal youth in invisible realms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a clink of wine jars from the adjoining
table. A rough band of mountain bandits had
come in and were drinking heavily with some
Antioch merchants. A lewd oath followed by
loud laugh came from the drunken group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has ruined half the physicians of Antioch
by her magic healing! She has interfered with the
sale of silver images of Diana and Venus by our
silversmiths; and now with her religious house in
the grottos and caves for the dancing girls of
Daphne Gardens and half Rome here for winter
pleasure, what is to become of our maids for the
Love Temples?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old is she?” asked a bearded fellow, who
seemed to be leader of the bandit group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old—that’s it—that’s her hold on these dancing
girls! She keeps eternally young with her
magic and has lured away half our daughters with
her lies of a Christ, who can never die, and a love
that is cheated of a young girl’s dreams. I am a
silversmith—I know what I say—we have not
sold one image this year, where we used to sell
ten thousand.” The silversmith stroked his
beard and displayed the bracelets and rings of his
trade on his fat hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Lady Trefina left her great store of
Roman gold, you say?” asked the bandit eagerly.
“Does she keep that gold in her caves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not she, she is too crafty. That’s safe with
the money changers here and supports her schools
for girls. Besides, it buys protection from the
Roman captain here. He, who harms her, would
be impaled on the Roman wall here for the hawks
to pick his skull—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my band of wild boars could destroy a
woman without harming her.” It was then the
bandit leader repeated the lewd oath that had
first startled the two Greek Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ply my young men with wine enough to-night,
and we’ll prove her a courtesan breaking
the law without the red cord about her brow,
which the law enacts. Once prove on oath we’ve
spent a night in her cave—the laws of Antioch will
do the rest. The Roman guard here would drive
them out like swine and throw them to the wild
beasts in the hippodrome. We’d have our dancing
girls back in Daphne Gardens and no more of this
folly of heifers thinking they lead the herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heads of the group went together over the
wine tankards of the table in lowered tone with
ugly laugh on the part of the mountain bandits
and oily smile from the Antioch merchants. The
bandit chief rose. He whistled. Half a dozen
young fellows from the mountain clans with long
swords in sashes and dirks in slings dangling from
the right wrist appeared in the portal of the patio
as if by magic. The chief signaled them to join
the table, and more wine and yet more wine was
ordered, as old and young heads went together in
undertones above the center of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Greek Christians rose and passed out
from the patio of the inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this woman teacher of the Christian
faith they mean to attack to-night?” demanded the
aged man, Apollos. “Said I not the new wine was
bursting the old bottles—the spiritual is defeating
the carnal, and we need youth in fighting rank
to keep the faith clean as a Damascus sword?
Who is this woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not, Apollos, unless one Thecla, a
convert of Paul’s twenty years ago in Iconium,
when I was youth and captured by these same
bandits. She was said to have escaped to the
caves near Antioch, where she set up schools for
the maids, who run away from the Love Temples
of Daphne Gardens. She toils so secretly few
know how or where she dwells, except that a great
Roman lady left her fortune enough to buy protection
of Rome—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is vile work afoot to-night, Onesimus.
We must call the Roman guard and hasten up to
protect her caves till they come. Do you instruct
our tent men, while I see the Roman captain.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Up and up over circling trail they rode the
rough mountain pass that led between the sea and
Antioch. Larch, oak, fir and pine forest closed
behind them darkening as they pushed their panting
horses up the steep ascent. Mountain torrents
rushed down to right and left in the sibilant
hush of night slacking the thaw of upper snows.
Narrower and narrower led the pass till the
riders could have tossed a biscuit from side to
side of the precipices closing in cañon cleft. Above
tree line, the clouds enfolded them in a silken gauze
cool as wind on hot face; and above the cloud
line, they rode in a world of silver moonlight, with
black shadows of the rock walls etched in ink and
the howl of hyena and jackal reëchoing through
the caves. The stars were lanterns hung in a
lucent blue that seemed but a hand reach away
from the two silent riders. Once, as they passed
the dark mouth of a grotto in the rock wall
washed by the tumbling cascade of waters over
the precipice, they heard the roar of a lion that
set all the mountains in echo. The precipices on
either side of the pass now came together in overhanging
arch not a lance length apart and, as they
passed under the shadow, a mountain cataract
leaped down—rainbow colored in the mist of
moonlight, but the path seemed to be ending in a
blind wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She chose her hiding place well,” said Apollos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would need to,” answered Onesimus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is her religious house?” asked the aged
man, as they breathed their horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus was no longer presbyter and prospective
bishop. He was mountain boy again as he
had been twenty years ago before the bandits had
captured him, and his eyes were searching the face
of the rock cleft where only a silver bar showed
open space, as an eagle might scout for its hidden
nest. An eagle did at that very moment utter
shrill warning of human intrusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” answered Onesimus, “must be her
sentry of danger; for she was mountain born as
I am; and we always chose camp near an eagle’s
nest for warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eagle uttered its woeful cry again to fore,
and they passed through the arch. The rock
walls here were pitted with grottos as they are to
this day; and we, who smile at the early Christians
adopting monastic life to flee the world, the flesh
and the devil in these early ages, should remember
that it was often life in the grottos, or death by
wild beasts in the hippodrome. In one place the
silvered mossed rock seemed to have been stoned
up in front. Past this place, tumbled another
cataract. Dwellers in the grottos always chose
sites with good drinking water inside. Onesimus
pointed ahead, drew his sword and moved forward.
To the side where the cataract gushed out
was a door of long slabs so narrow a man must
enter sideways. Onesimus knocked on the door.
A wicket in the logs opened; and we, who laugh at
wickets in the doors of monastic houses, would do
well to recall how and why such wickets were first
used. They were used to save the lives of those
who kept the faith for us. A woman’s face appeared
in the wicket. It was a face in its late
thirties, but it was a face that would always be
young; for it had not a line of care or envy. Was
it the moonlight; or was it a trick of Onesimus’
own memories of Paul long ago in the prison hut
of Rome; for the face wore the radiance that
artists have vainly tried to portray in halo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are disciples of Paul,” he said in Greek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman flung the door open and drew
them in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grotto was empty but for a taper beneath
a wooden cross, but at the far end was a cleft in
the rock—the real end of the pass leading to
grottos deeper in the mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And He shall hide His own in a cleft in the
rock,” said Apollos. “Go you within and tell the
Lady Thecla why we are here. Keep your sword
drawn at the cleft in the rock. If they break past
my guard, strike as they go through yon crack in
the wall. I would open the wicket when the
rioters come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no record of what the drunken rioters
said, when the wicket opened on a white bearded
face instead of woman’s; but when they would
have smashed the door and forced entrance,
Apollos drew a sword with blade fine as Damascus
razor and inquired calmly in tones too soft to be
safe what he might do for them. How could he
serve them best? They paused at that and fell
back under the arch to confer. Came a thunder
of iron hoofs echoing in rip-rap over the stone
road and the drunken crew turned to flee pursuit
of Roman guard; but flee—where? This road
ended in the blind wall of a stoned up cavern.
They dashed back for hiding in the caves lower
down. There were echoes, oaths, clash of swords
on metal armor, neigh and scream of terrified
horses; and a Roman centurion galloped to the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do with your trapped beasts?
Have you taken them prisoners?” demanded
Apollos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We took no prisoners. Not one escaped. We
drove them over the precipice. Yon eagle will
have full crop for her nestlings to-morrow; and
that lion below will not roar so loud in hunger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Thecla lived to the great age of ninety
years and her memory is kept sacred on September
24, to this day. Without dancing girls for the
Love Temples of Daphne Gardens, all the beauty
and lure of the place failed to hold the wintering
pleasure seekers of Antioch. The very winter
that Onesimus passed over the Roman Road to
become Bishop of Ephesus, the great Love Temples
of Venus were destroyed by fire. The Christians
said they had been struck by lightning as a
manifestation of God’s vengeance for the attempt
on the Thecla Community, even as lightning had
once before delivered her from the Adversary.
The merchants of Antioch, who yearly spent a
hundred thousand talents to draw the pleasure
seekers from Rome to winter in Daphne Gardens,
said the Christians had set them on fire; but the
lure of Daphne Gardens fell off from that year.
To this day, you can find signs of the Cross and inscriptions
by the early Christians in the grottos
and caverns, between Antioch and the sea; but of
Daphne Gardens, hardly enough remains to mark
the site, did we not know it was ten miles in circumference,
and five miles from the four hundred
crumbling marble towers of Antioch. War and
plunder broke the power of Antioch; and what
war and plunder could not destroy, the earthquake
threw down; but the Faith kept holy in the grotto
is reënacted to-day wherever “the new wine bursts
the old bottles” and the Loving Cup goes round
to commemorate Him who first broke women’s
fetters.</p>

<div><h1 id='p_174'>CHAPTER V<br/> <br/> “AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE DEATH”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop of Ephesus sat dreaming in the
garden between his church and his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the glad season now known as
Easter, some fifty years after the death and
ascension of our Lord. The sunshine of the
Ægean Sea was a luminous glory that clothed all
the world of spring in garments of pure light.
The city square swam in a transparent gold that
dazzled the eye. Across the square, the aërial
arches between the columns of the Great Temple
to Diana gave glimpses of a sea that was by turns
turquoise blue and emerald green, with a fret of
snowy waves whose mermaid hair danced rainbows
in the sunlight. Between the arcades of the
Temple columns, the Bishop could catch hints of
the surrounding circle of snowy mountains; and
they, too, swam opal jewels in a mirage of morning
light. The years had touched Onesimus lightly.
He was stouter, stronger, more robust; but few
silver hairs intermingled with his gold curls,
though an austere strength now stamped face and
figure, as of a man, whose shoulders had grown
the broader for their load. But the gladness of the
day brought back memories of his youth, this
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What wonder—he mused—the Greeks’ frieze
across the top of the Temple columns represented
their huntress Deity as driving the wild horses
of the waves with the wind in their tossing manes
out to the pasture grounds of the ocean deeps?
The Bishop dreaming in the garden between his
little Christian church and his house smiled; for
though he was Christian, he was also Greek; and
never the sun came over the snowy mountains in
spring but he felt the wild lure of the huntress,
Diana, with her silver horn winding through the
woods and caves, leading youth captive in pursuit
of the fleet-foot rainbow hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something there was in the glad spring day of
the beginning of time, “when the morning stars
sang together and all the Sons of God shouted
for joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So sitting in the garden across the city square
from the vast marble Temple to Diana, he could
not but smile gently to himself. Spite of statue
in silver like a spire to sky, and domes that vied in
beauty the opals of the snowy peaks, and friezes
that were the glory of Grecian art for two hundred
years—not so many worshipers came from
the seas and hills to the Great Diana’s Temple.
Especially, not so many worshipers came to the
Temple now that the Roman conqueror persisted
in setting up images of the Emperors to be worshiped
equal with Diana. That very year, vestal
virgins had suffered death for refusing to offer
incense to the figure of the Roman Emperor—“Beast
worship” it was now called among the
Greeks; and after the martyrdom of these vestals,
the young Christian Bishop reflected, his own little
church had been crowded with new adherents to
the new faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three vestal virgins had been accused of
breaking their girdle vows; but Onesimus knew the
real cause of their death had been—they had
laughed at the Goddess Roma set up beside the
Great Diana; and when the Great Diana had
failed to protect them, faith in her power had
fallen off. The people knew the Temple was a
cheat to barter gain for sacrifice and hold allegiance
to Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Books of Black Magic to the value of more
than £2,000 had been burned at Ephesus after
Paul’s labors there; and what Paul had preached,
Apollos had confirmed, speaking from the very
shrine of Diana, herself. Truly what Paul “had
planted, Apollos had watered, and God had given
the increase.” He thought of Ephesus, the third
greatest city in the known world, with its theater
holding fifty thousand pleasure seekers, where his
little old half-blind, deformed Master, Paul, with
the lion heart and sword of the spirit had conquered
the Prince of the Powers of the Air—whether
Black or White Magic, Onesimus did not
know. He only knew the Invisible King had conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aquila and Priscilla had won Apollos, the
Gnostic, to Christ, and had accompanied Paul to
Ephesus; and when Paul had left Ephesus to go
on to Rome, it was Apollos who had driven the
Christ message home; so that now Ephesus, rather
than Antioch, was the rallying point for the followers
in Asia. The fall of Jerusalem had dispersed
all followers there to the deserts of Asia
and Egypt. The incursions of the victorious
Roman Army had driven the Jews from Antioch.
At Ephesus must be the final stand of the followers
for the Christ against pagan god and Jewish
legalism and the Black Magic of the sorcerers,
now a scourge over all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was Apollos an Apostate, “a wandering star,”
as Peter and the others had feared? Certainly,
he had failed to come to the rescue of Paul, in
Corinth and Rome, when Paul’s need had been
sore; but then, he had defied the pagan gods in
their own temples, while Paul always spoke from
Jewish synagogue, or from market place; and
John had reported the Master’s words—that
those not against Him, were for Him; and
Apollos had one message and Paul another; and
both led like Jacob’s ladder to God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fewer and fewer animals from the mountain
herds went to the Temple as sacrifices; and the
trade in little silver images of Diana had fallen
away so that the silversmiths had removed their
booths from the Temple columns. The space,
where the silversmiths’ booths used to stand, now
was taken up with aged and infant ragged beggars,
imploring alms from the worshipers by day and
by night, huddling to sleep behind the shelter of
the columns. He could see these poor shipwrecks
of port life this morning, shaking off their drowsiness
and tatters to begin another dull round of
another dull day; and yet—and yet—the legend
of Diana’s silver hunting horn winding divine
music through the mountain passes to the
sea was in the young Greek Bishop’s very
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The perfume of the morning flowers had no
drugged night bloom. It was clean, dew-washed,
elusive as light. Dewdrops still lay on the lips
of the purple iris, the white narcissus, the voluptuous
flaunting tulips. Spider webs spun with
diamonds of light and dew hung in the acacia and
oleander hedges. The great Easter lilies lifted
royal spears of gold and cups of nectar to greet
the rising sun—easterly always pointed the spears
and cups to the sun god; and on the stone edge of
the garden fountain, a bird with a dash of
sapphire blue and ruby red on his throat was
caroling love notes to burst his little palpitating
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop closed his eyes in a prayer that was
an inarticulate gloria to the gladness of Life, and
it was to the Glad Kingdom of Life in Newness
that he had dedicated his life long ago, when he
had rushed as a boy from pursuit of the kidnappers
of Rome right into the prison hut of Paul,
the Apostle of Christ, who had opened the doors
of that Glad Kingdom. A bird’s wing almost
brushed the Bishop’s face. He opened his eyes
to one of those common tragedies of garden life,
seen every day if we have eyes that see. Some
insect of an early butterfly sort had come out of
winter chrysalis pale, faint, trembling with the effect
of casting off the dead body of its winter
shell of skin, and was fanning moist wings dry in
the morning sun, when the little feathered songster
with a dart past the Bishop’s face, snatched
away the dead shell body, while the pale nymph
rose in giddy circles in the dazzling light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop Onesimus gave a start. The nymph
didn’t seem to realize that it had died to one form
of life and risen to another. It had thrown aside
what the Greeks called its “coat of skin” just as
the beggars yonder under the Temple arches were
folding up their night rags and coming out in the
sun on the city square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little drama of the garden had enacted his
very prayer; for what was the bird singing but a
gloria to glad new life? And what was the nymph
doing but casting off the body of death for rebirth
to new life? And was not this the very thought
that had been puzzling him this morning of the
ascension of his Lord on what we to-day call
Easter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been reading John, the Beloved’s, last
message to the Christian Churches of the Great
Roman Road with warnings against the Beast
Worship and foreflashes of things to come down
the long ages. Of all the first messengers of the
Glad News, John only, the disciple of Christ, and
Apollos, the disciple of John the Baptist, remained
on earth. Paul, beheaded in Rome! Peter,
crucified in Rome! Matthew, Mark, Luke lost to
history in Egypt! James martyred in Jerusalem!
Thomas buried in the Far East! Philip disappeared
in Ethiopia!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All were what the world called—Dead!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost twenty years had passed since the Fall
of the Holy City, when he and Apollos coming
from Jordan Ford had passed through Antioch
and rescued Thecla in the mountain caves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet here was John’s letter from banishment on
Patmos Island, his last message to the Seven
Christian Churches of the Great Roman Road,
declaring “there shall be no more death,” and
here was Paul’s letter to the Corinthians sent forward
to be read to his own flock in Ephesus, declaring
death was but a change of garment, an
awakening from shadowy dreaming sleep to an
effulgent intensest reality of life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop strode back to his cloister. As he
passed from his garden, he noticed the ragged
horde of beggars coming out from the night shelter
of Diana’s Temple to range themselves in posture
of mendicants whining for alms across the
city square. There was a child—a little ragged
Greek with no clothing but a torn belted shirt,
with tousled head, bare of feet, not more than
eight years old, with a baby in a sling on his back.
The baby’s eyes had been blinded and one arm
broken—to arouse pity among passers-by. Onesimus
had noticed these children before; and it
made his mountain blood boil, for had not his
Lord said—“Let little children come unto me?”
And had not the prophets predicted: “A little
child shall lead them?” And did this look as if
the Shepherd of little children were protecting
them; as if the spirit of the child were leading
men back to God? It was as if a cloud of doubt
suddenly obscured the gladness of the Easter
morning. For a moment, he watched the byplay
on the city square—the little Greek had stolen a
flower from some city hedge. A tall angular spare
woman clad all in black had come out of the Diana
Temple from an all-night vigil. The child beggar
was running along with the blind baby on his back
wobbling its head from side to side, trying to sell
her the stolen flower for a farthing. He made a
clutch at the tall woman’s skirts to try and force
her attention. She turned on him with imperious
gesture and snatched her skirt from his hand so
roughly that the little beggar with the baby on his
back fell face down on the Temple steps; then
something seemed to clutch at the heart strings
of the woman’s own memories; for she paused,
turned back and from the wallet in her pocket
girdle, threw the child a handful of coins that
flashed bronze and gold in the sun. It was as if
the cloud of sadness that had obscured the gladness
of the Easter morning had vanished like mist
in sun.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus entered the cloister off the side of his
little Christian church. He was tall, thin and
athletic from his active life and inheritance of
mountain blood. Religion was to him not the
old-age anodyne to jaded physical sensations dying
of the fungus that kills a fly in frost. It was the
essence compounded of more Life and more
Light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Growing old in the Kingdom is growing
young,” he smiled. “What have we to fear from
old wives’ fables of the dark?” and he flung himself
in a stone chair below the cloister window
and took up the letter of John to the Seven
Churches of the Great Roman Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Progress had been rapid since he was a slave
lad in Rome and Paul wrote on clay and wax
tablets. Progress is always swift when we look
back, but slow as a snail when we look forward;
for John’s letters were on skin parchment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light came from the side of his church
across from his cloister. He had to bend and
strain his vision to decipher the penmanship of
the aged disciple and it stabbed him to the quick,
that message to his own little church at Ephesus—an
oasis of faith in a pagan desert of whirling
doubts—a message from his Unseen Lord
through the hand of John: “I know your works,
your toil, your patience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have never
grown weary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet you no longer love Me as
you did at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could that be true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did the Church no longer love Her Lord as at
first?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she grown cold with habit? Or was it fear
of death being the end-all that had chilled the fire
of their first zeal? They had expected the King
to return in a blaze of glory; and here was John’s
message pointing to the glory as Kingdom Unseen,
where spirits must clothe them in garments of
light, where the building stones of the many mansions
would be precious jewels of beautiful deeds,
where the leaves from the Tree of Life would be
for the healing of all nations—all nations, not
just Jew and Greek—and where forgiveness
would be a cup of forgetfulness to begin Life
afresh in the Kingdom of Gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it Doubt that had chilled love in Ephesus?
For when he had come to that line—“And there
shall be no more Death”—hadn’t he paused,
staggered in belief, because he knew that all the
apostles but Apollos and John were dead? At
that very line had he not heard in memory the
winding music of the huntress’ horn, when Diana’s
horses came champing down the mountains to
plunge in the pastures of the sea? If Death were
end-all, better ride the wild horses of joy down to
the eternal sea!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it Doubt that had chilled Love?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus sprang from his stone chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would settle it once and for all. John, the
Beloved, was on Patmos Isle; Apollos of John
Baptist’s band on Crete—but a few hours’ sail in
a spanking breeze from Ephesus. He would go
and ask them if Death itself were slain, robbed of
its victory, deadened of its pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it true “there was to be no more Death?”
If true, Onesimus wanted to shout the glad news
from the housetops. The very stones should cry
out in joy, the leaves clap hands in rhythmic dance,
and all the feathered songsters give voice in a
gloria chant. Joy would be the voice of God in
many laughing waters; and the human body would
no longer be dogged by shadow, when Death, the
spy, with skeleton face in the dark, was slain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the young Bishop sprang up, a shadow
fell athwart the morning light streaming in beams
of gold across his church into his cloister. It was
the shadow of the woman clad all in black; the
woman he had noticed coming out from all-night
vigil in the Temple of Diana and tossing the gold
and bronze coins to the beggar child, whom her
rough jerk had thrown down the marble steps.
She stood in the shadow of the gold light gazing
at him. She was not young. He knew by
her hair and fair skin that like himself, she was
Greek; but there was something almost sibylline
in her tense silence. Her skin was pale as white
wax. Her lips were parted and painted, showing
teeth white as pearls; and in her great dark eyes
were both the insolence and unfathomable sadness
of a woman fleeing in vain from the skeleton
clutch of age and catching in vain at the rainbow
hours of youth. She was measuring the strength
of an almost feline cunning against the strength
of his clarity before she spoke; and there was that
in her, which could bait cunning with flesh and
set a man guessing of her past. She was richly
clad and decked in jewels, from the pearls in her
hair to the jade in the clasp of her sandals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled a slow smile with her lips, which
had no reflex of joy in her eyes, than which is no
sadder smile on earth—’twas like a mask on a
death face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you good morrow, Sirrah,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not—‘Sirrah,’ ” quietly answered the Bishop
Onesimus in a silent rebuke to familiar approach,
“nor much need to wish good morning when God
gives free such day as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She winced but did not retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I address you?” she asked smiling
faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In sincerity and truth, as I shall answer you,
Lady. If you speak truth to a liar, it conceals
you best, for he takes all truth for lie. If you
speak lie to a liar, it accomplishes nothing; for
he regards all words as lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She winced this time and glanced away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wait for you to invite me to be seated,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The empty chair has already invited you,
Lady.” He waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seated herself, but had lost her air of
insolence and no longer baited her dark eyes with
a flicker of dare to a man’s guess of her past.
Into them had come the terrible pleading of a
dumb brute for respite from unseen foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do for you, Lady?” asked the
young Bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into her face came the wan wistful smile of
a gambler’s last cast of the dice. Her glance
fell. She leaned forward across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not mad. Do not think me mad. You
ask what can you do for me? I have both heard
and seen your miracles from faith. Years ago,
when I was a widow in Iconium, I saw your
leader, Paul, work such miracles, but when I sent
a magician out to bribe him to tell the secret of
his tricks, I could learn nothing. Then he bewitched
my only daughter, and she deserted her
affianced husband, and joined the Christian sect
and has kept house for what she calls her holy
women in the hills on the Roman Road for over
twenty years. I am an old woman, but she is”—the
woman stammered—“she is eternally young.
She wears a youth and radiance that grow with
growing years, while I—I flee a skeleton called
age that clutches me as I run; but she sits quiet
while the death’s head of age slips past, leaving
her all untouched. You ask me what can you do
for me? I prayed all night in Diana’s Temple.
I offered incense enough to redeem ten slaves.
I am not mad. Do not think me mad. I would
pay any price. Here is the gold. I gave a ragged
beggar child gold enough to make his parents
rich, but to be told which way you lived. I would
buy from you your secret of eternal youth. How
do you cheat age and death? Why are you happier
as you grow older?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astounded Bishop fell back with a gasp.
It was as if a dark shadow made of self in withered
flesh had cast itself athwart the translucent
gladness of the spring morning, and would hold
the rainbow in its dead and greedy hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you the Mother who cast her daughter
out to the dogs of the midnight streets in Iconium
years ago, because she would not marry the man
to whom you sold her? Are you the Mother
of Thecla, whom Paul converted?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman did not answer. She cowered like
a dumb brute from a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s mercy is long enough to reach down
and pardon the meanest,” he went on. “God
wills not that anything He has created should
perish, but even now, you think only of self;
and self is the demon that locks you in your
dungeon. When I saw you fling the beggar child
down the stone steps and then relent and throw
the coins after him, I thought it was repentance
of your own hard heart; but now I know ’twas
but another offering made to the god of self to
find another temple where your prayer might be
answered when you had failed with Diana. Even
now, you think not of the fate that your cruelty
brought on your daughter! You think only of
saving yourself from skeleton age and death! Self
is the vampire that sucks life and youth and
radiance to dry shell. Cast self out and let the
waters of life in. When you have pondered that,
come back for admission to the Kingdom of Gladness;
and your own daughter Thecla can open the
door and give you the secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode from the cloister in the towering
rage of a man who has seen a daughter thrown
to the wild beasts by the selfishness of a mother.
The woman’s body rocked with paroxysm of self-pity
in the stone chair of the cloister.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The woman and her selfish request that would
have made out of miracles a slave to self passed
from the Bishop’s mind like a cloud that darkens
our path for a moment, then vanishes, leaving
not the shadow of a substance. His quest was
a shining light that eclipsed every other impression
from his being. Before they could pass beyond
his reach, he would go to his aged master,
Apollos in Crete, and to John, the Beloved, in
Patmos, and ask them in verity if that message
in the letter to the Seven Churches of the Roman
Road was to be taken in spiritual parable, or in
letter truth—that there was to be no more Death.
If the Kingdom were here and now, then like
the insect nymph on the fountain stone, Death
was but the change of a worn out fleshy garment
for a vesture of light. Being still in his prime,
Onesimus, the Bishop, did not realize that his
quest was the self-same search as that of the aged
woman, bent and broken under sin at the end
of the road where there is no turning. All he
realized was that if the Christ’s ascension meant
no more Death, then this springtime anniversary
marked a gladness of earth and air and sea, that
created a New Heaven and a New Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Bishop stood at the prow watching the
carved eagle’s head noiselessly cut the calm seas
between Ephesus and Crete, his soul was wrapped
in the deep calm of the beauty of the night. The
silver moon above hung silver in the water below.
Only a cat’s-paw of wind was in the canvas. The
rowers below plied their oars as one man, keeping
time to some old rhythmic chant that was like
the croon of the wind. The Christian Bishop was
Greek and the hypnotic rune carried his racial
memories back—back—back to the minstrelsy of
hill clan and seaman, to myths of the Isles
of Greece—Minotaur—Bull-God—to whom the
maidens were offered; Mammon—God of Gold—to
whom the youths were offered; and raids over
the mountain and sea to steal the victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Onesimus, standing musing, the real world
had become a dream world, when a sailor at the
prowl spoke to him in Greek:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you this coin, Master? Is it gold or
bronze?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seaman was clad only in trunks and loose
shirt, with bare feet and bare head. He had a
capstan bar over his left shoulder, but between
the forefinger and thumb of his right hand he
held a rudely minted coin with roughly stamped
insignia, which glittered yellow in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is gold. It is a very old coin. How did
you come by it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus had taken the coin and was turning
it over and over in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seaman’s apple cheeks and gray beard
curled in a smile. “My son, he sleeps under the
steps of the Temple. Some rich merchant wife
from the Roman Road spends the night, night
after night, praying to Diana in the Temple.
Diana does not give her what she asks; so then
she comes out angry in the morning and asks
the way to the Temple of your new God, and
my son, he show her the way, and she throw him
a handful of coin. I think, my master, she make
mistake. All the rest was bronze. My son, he
said she had a hard stiff face—you know its value,
Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus had handed back the coin. He was
hardly hearing the seaman’s words. He was
thinking of the scene in the morning, when he
had doubted the value of a child to the Kingdom;
and now he knew that the beggar child with the
maimed baby on its back had led Thecla’s mother
to the door of the Kingdom, and he had clashed
the door in her face because of past sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you its value, Master?” repeated the
seaman. “Will it buy my freedom and my daughter’s,
too? She is a slave girl in the Temples of
Crete and is wasting of a consumption. I would
take her back to a good woman in the hills off
the Roman Road—a Grecian woman called
Thecla. Know you her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus came awake to pressing duties, like
a dreamer out of selfish trance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, its value is three times the value of a
slave; and I will now give you six times its value
in Roman coin to countervail my sin of this very
morning.” He had opened the leather wallet
in his sash and was counting six coins out for the
seaman’s one, when a thought arrested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who mutilated the infant on your beggar-boy’s
back? Is this girl child also yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my Master,” the Greek seaman’s countenance
saddened. “I sink not so low. The little
child is daughter of the Roman guard at
Patmos; but I am slave seaman for debt; and
the witch, the fortune teller, at the Temple steps,
who keeps my son and forces him to beg, she
it was who maimed the infant. She feeds the
children who are leased, and forces them to earn
bread. The infant was only a female and will be
knocked on the head; so the witch blinded her
and broke her arm—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gone were the Bishop’s dreams of a world of
Light and Life and Love! Gone were his memories
of Diana and her hunting horn winding
divine music through the caves and grottoes of
the Isles of Greece. He was down to earth with
his feet on the ground, a warrior again for
righteousness in a world of crime. What mattered
the coward fear of Death? His duty as
a soldier of His Lord was to fight for right in
Life, and let Death take care of itself, as the
nymph insect that morning had discarded its
coat of skin to the winds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He added another coin to the six he was counting
out to the seaman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See you redeem the infant as well, and take
them all to the hospice of the woman Thecla in
the mountains,” he commanded. “I will stand
bail for your good citizenship when you get your
pass of freedom from the Roman Governor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cusps of the mountains of Crete
were sighted, and the great canvas came clattering
down, and the ship warped up to the quay,
the burly seaman—no longer slave but free—came
to Onesimus with a capstan bar over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will need me, Master,” he said. “There
are riots in Crete. One Apollos proclaims the
downfall of the old Temples. They threaten to
kill him to-night if he break in on the service.
For me, I see not why they should kill him. He
is old—they say he is a hundred years—he will
die anyway; and he preaches— ‘There is no
Death.’ ” The big seaman exploded in a bluff
laugh through his beard that was like the burst
of a squall through a mountain pass; and the
two went shouldering up through the dock rabble
towards the temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say,” went on the seaman with the new-found
tongue of a slave suddenly free, “this
Apollos kept silent for five whole years in the
Lodges of India. Silent—not a word—only
signs; but he learned their magic and can fight
the demons of air. ’Twas he gave my girl in
the Temple a cup of forgetfulness and bade her
seek healing with the Greek woman, Thecla, in
the mountain caves off the Roman Road. He
preaches Gladness like you, Master, and always
Light—Light—Light—a path up to the dwellings
of the gods,” the seaman laughed again. He was
not sure whether his garrulous babble were passing
through the Bishop’s outer ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he teach?” asked Onesimus, curious
to learn a slave’s views of the Glad News.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we have no wants, we’ll seek few possessions,”
continued the seaman. “The winds are
spirits—light is a garment—prayers are the smell
of flowers—incense is their seed—and he speaks
only in the Temple at night because he says men
will remember his words in their sleep—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, should the Temple priests threaten
to kill him?” asked the Bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seaman paused in his march, shouldering
through the crowds. He evidently could not do
two things at once—walk and talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I know, my Master?” The burly
fellow thought. “He is rich. He needs no money.
He tells the people to give no money to the
priests—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” ordered the Bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seaman lowered the capstan bar from his
shoulder and began poking a pass through the
throngs. So great was the press at the main
entrance to the Temple that the seaman turned
aside and wedged a way through the flanking
crowd into the darkened cloisters down each side
of the vast edifice to the Sun. The Temple was
roofless. On the main central floor knelt thousands
in worship. Censer lights hung on chains
across the front of the altar and beneath the
lights chanted the priests in full-chested chorus,
old as time, to the moon and sun deities, while
the voice of the vestal virgins and the boy choristers
rose shrill and clear from the galleries above
the cloisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go redeem your daughter in the galleries from
the priests while I find the Apostle Apollos,” directed
Onesimus, “then meet me at the ship!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to find the Apostle Apollos was no easy
matter in this dim light clouded with incense and
mist blowing in from the sea. The sailor went
clambering the stone stairs to the upper galleries,
while Onesimus picked his way past the prostrate
worshipers towards the altar, where Apollos
would be likely to appear if he dared to try
to speak after the singing. Then, he caught sight
of the venerable Apostle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mistaking that aged and beautiful
figure—dressed in pure white, with cork
sandals, with hair and beard as white as washed
silk, and brow as lineless and radiant as the snowy
mountain peaks—standing calmly against one of
the Temple pillars to the side of the high smoke-clouded
altar; but when Onesimus would have
pressed forward to him, he found the way through
the last cloister stopped by a half-dozen bloodhounds
tied to the Temple columns to prevent
the rescue of Apollos by his followers; and one
glance told Onesimus that Apollos stood so motionless
because he was bound by ankles and
wrists to the upright column.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah,” said a bearded Roman guard clad in
armor to his eyes, who was standing behind the
leashed bloodhounds, “he saved others; let him
save himself! He raised others from death by
his magic tricks. Now he’s dead man himself
under this wolf pack if he budge a hair, where
he stands. Give me the leashes. I’ll let the line
out to close on him, when the singing stops,”
and suiting the act to the word, the Roman took
the leash ends of the bloodhounds and gave them
line to creep up within touch of the bound man
if he but stirred a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus moved up cautiously behind the
Roman. He had the short dirk in his belt that
all Greeks wore, and from the gold cord round
his neck hung the usual traveler’s sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was of two minds—whether to trip the
Roman guard and snatch the bloodhounds’ leash,
or jump forward in the gathering cloud of mist
and incense, cut Apollos’ bonds and himself divert
the attack of the bloodhounds—when he
noticed something with his keen mountaineer eye
that the Roman guard did not see. Apollos’
wrists and ankles had been bound to the pillar
by deer thongs. The hounds had sniffed forward
and were licking at the deer thongs; and through
the dark, Apollos’ gleaming black eyes were boring
to Onesimus’ very soul with unspoken message.
They forbade word or move for his rescue.
They seemed to redirect the younger man’s
glance back to the bloodhounds. The blood
hounds were licking the deer thongs and the raw
hide was stretching as it always stretches when
wet, and Apollos had let it slip down over his
hands from his wrists to the floor, where the
dogs, in growling and snarling to snatch at it, had
bitten through the thongs binding his ankles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Apostle did not move by a hair’s breadth.
His brow was radiant with a glowing light and
his hair shone like fuller’s white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cymbals clashed. The silver trumpets
blew. The lines of chanting priests had seized
bells to ring in rhythm and fans to send up the
clouds of incense. And there was heard the
hunting horn of Diana coming down from the
fleecy meadows of mid-heaven to pasture her
stallions and mares in the ocean deeps—the vestal
virgins’ high clear soprano gave back refrain to
the chant of the priests—when a blast of wind
from the tidal waves of Diana’s stallions and
mares champing out to sea, blew through the
Temple pillars, sending the clouds of incense and
mist back over the worshipers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus saw Apollos leap from the pillar to
the altar stairs; and when the Roman guard
would have unleashed the hounds to tear him
down, an unseen foot tripped the soldier to his
face on the tessellated floor of the Temple, and
the hounds were upon the fellow in a savage attack
that called the attention of the priests. Taking
quick advantage of the diversion and the
back-blown cloud of sea mist and incense smoke,
Onesimus with a bound followed his Master, who
had passed swiftly to the stairs behind the altar,
that led both to the vestal virgins’ galleries above
and to the famous underground labyrinths of
Crete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me not, beloved! Farewell,” Apollos
had turned. “Escape back to the ship with your
seaman and his daughter! Take them to Thecla
in the caves! Seek me not! Farewell for a
little time—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the cymbals clashed. Again the silver
trumpets blew. Again the bells rang in rhythm
to the chant of the priests and refrain of vestals.
Again the fans sent back the cloud of incense
above the altar. Again was heard Diana’s hunting
horn coming down from the fleecy meadows
of mid-heaven to pasture her stallions and mares
in the ocean deeps; but of Apollos was nought
to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah,” said a Roman guard standing near the
astounded Bishop of Ephesus, “ ’twas but a trick
of levitation, which all these Eastern magic fellows
play. The fellow has lifted himself up by
his sandal straps and disappeared through the
clouds of smoke, as he did when he was tried
before our Emperor Domitian for tearing a boy’s
entrails out. Wasn’t I there? Didn’t I see him?
Didn’t he defy our Emperor to his face? They
could prove nothing against the scoundrel—he
wraps himself in his cloak like this”—the guard
imitated a man hiding his face in his cape— “I
see him plain as I see you, we all see him, the
Emperor was about to have him seized and
burned as all these Greeks and Jewish sorcerers
ought to be burned—and there, as we look, the
knave disappears from our very eyes and reappears
down in a cave among his followers by the
sea, where he takes ship and flees for Asia again.
If I’d been Emperor, I’d have had him seized
where found and burned on the spot. ’Tis only
a trick of levitation—holding the breath, mumbling
a hocus-pocus, and up they go—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simpler than that, Friend Roman,” responded
a Greek priest of the Temple, whose head was
shaved like a billiard ball and whose face wore
the baffled look of one stunned by anger and
fear. “There are thirty thousand secret chambers
in the old Minos Temples ’neath the Island here,
where all the Black Magic books of old have
been hidden for a thousand years. The knave
must have known the secret passage to these
hidden underground caves, where ’tis like he hides
now with all his followers and rocks this Isle.
’Tis known the Isle always rocks in the spring
and autumn storms—and the old Greeks say ’tis
from the Black Magic of the Masters in the
Caves. The man wrought Black Magic against
our Goddess. He ought to have been burned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I notice,” said another, “that he had no
shadow. These demons have no shadow—’tis
how we Greeks know demons in human form;
and he always wore a ring with a mystic stone
got from the Magicians of India to protect
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A plague on these cursed Gnostics and Essenes
and Nazarenes,” gritted a Jew, joining the
amazed group. “They are turning the whole
world upside down. Feed them to the beasts,
I say, as they did in the mad Nero’s day.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus came out to the star-silvered night,
dazed and dumb. Was there “no more Death”?
He could not answer. He stood by the rocky
coast of the calm painted sea with the Greek
freed seaman and his daughter rescued from the
Temple service. Snow was falling in a white
mantle on the upper peaks of the opaline mountains.
Was it “the Angel of the Snows” of which
Apollos and Enoch taught? Hoar frost seemed
to be lining the upper forested evergreens in the
glint of jewels. Was it the Angel of the Hoar
Frost? Mist was rising from the sea to meet
the mist from the mountains in ghostly curtains.
Was it the Spirit of the Mist wrapping its vesture
around the departed Apostle? And the winds
began to chant a mystic rune where the sea and
rock met in the white fret of the night tide. Was
it the Angel of the Winds, which, Apollos had
taught, come out to gather earth thoughts for the
weal or woe of earth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop of Ephesus fell to his knees and
spent the rest of the night on the shore in prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the Bishop on his way home to Ephesus,
accompanied by the slave seaman freed and the
daughter redeemed from Temple service in Crete
on their voyage to Thecla’s hospice on the Roman
Road—paused at Patmos, the rocky desert isle,
where John, the Beloved, lived in banishment and
dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vessel beached at dawn and while the
sailors took on a fresh cargo of fish, Onesimus
asked the way to the hut of John, the exile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Roman guard was father of the infant
girl, whom the Greek sorceress at Ephesus had
leased and maimed to beg; and when the soldier
heard from the seaman of the coin which would
ransom six slaves redeeming his little daughter,
the guard told Onesimus how John’s banishment
had been revoked and the aged Disciple had gone
to Ephesus by the previous day’s boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder,” said the Roman guard, “is his
prison hut; and yonder, where you hear the roaring
seas, is his Vision Cave—there is the voice
of many waters there—go not too far in—the
maids of spray and rainbow hair”—and the man
laughed awkwardly at his own superstition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little white stone hut stood on the wave-fretted
rocks facing the burst of sunrise over the
green isles of Greece in the blue morning sea.
While the sailors loaded freight, the Bishop
wandered up to the prison hut of the last of the
Disciples. It was such a prison hut as Paul
had occupied at Rome—but in a quieter cleaner
haven, where the dawn came over sea and
peak in a Jacob’s Ladder to sleeping and waking
dreams, up and down which the Angels might
pass from Heaven to men’s souls. Blue and primrose
were the skies above. Emerald and white
were the seas below. Yellow and gold were the
spears of the sun, and opal were the peaks of
far mountains swimming between heaven and
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cave was a haven for a seer to dream or
commune with God for the wind played the harp
in the gaunt trees growing from the bare rocks;
and the voice of many waters sounded day and
night without ceasing, where wave fret beat in
the hollow resounding caverns of rock and landlocked
inlet; and the trickle of receding tides
through the fine sands was as the tinkling of
myriad little bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onesimus drew from his traveler’s case a
parchment; and here is what he read, as in a
trance between life and death:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sea gave up the dead, which were
in it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and death and the grave delivered up
the dead, which were in them; and they were
judged every man according to their works .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for
the first heaven and the first earth were passed
away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I heard a great voice out of the
heavens saying— Behold, the tabernacle of God
is with men, and he shall dwell with them and
be their God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be
any more pain; for the former things are passed
away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Behold I make all things new.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Write; for these words are true and faithful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain
of the water of life freely .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there shall
be no night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the Lord God giveth light
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Spirit and the bride say—come; And
let him that heareth say come! And let him that
is athirst come! And whosoever will, let him
take the water of life freely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” When he had
finished reading, the Bishop was no longer in
trance. He was in ecstasy. It was as if the
golden light of day dawn had photographed the
last message of the Last Disciple in letters of
celestial fire across the firmament of heaven and
earth to all time in a rainbow of eternal hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What matter whether his resurrection were a
physical body, a soul body, a spiritual body?
Paul, himself, had said, when wrapped away in
vision to a Third Heaven not made of hands,
that he knew not whether he was in “terrestrial”
or “celestial” body. Onesimus now knew that
neither matter nor spirit could perish—but only
change, and He who had created both would
govern what form they must take in the New
Heaven and the New Earth; and Christ would
give that cup of forgetfulness of sin from the
Book of Remembrance, which the pagan Greeks
promised from drink of their sacred spring. Then
suddenly, as if in a glimpse of cosmic consciousness,
he knew the veil was very thin—thinner in
every cycle of ages—as the Old crashed down,
the New grew up in its place—till the New became
a New Heaven and a New Earth, a New
Heaven on Earth; and he heard the voice of
many waters, “not only as the rite of baptism
for the turning from sin,” but as a river of living
waters flowing from the throne of God, to
carry mankind to the destiny of the Sons of God.
He knew the crucifixion of his Master had marked
the end of a cycle, and all His followers were
the Torch Bearers of the Glad News to future
ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship anchored at Ephesus too late for the
Bishop to get carriage up from the water front
to the city square. As far as one can judge
from the configuration of sands and ruins, the
distance was six or seven miles. Accompanied
by the Greek seaman, and the redeemed Temple
vestal, he walked the distance from tide water
to city square, where his own little church and
dwelling stood across from the Great Temple to
Diana Artemis. Opposite the pagan Temple, the
three left him to rouse the little beggar boy, who
commonly slept under the marble steps. The
Bishop’s intention was to prepare a cloister for
these travelers on the way to Thecla’s hospice
to sleep; then snatch a few moments of sleep,
himself, before presenting himself at his own
home where the aged John would be housed and
resting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silver colossus of the Goddess stood an
unearthly wraith in the pale dawn of the city
square. The morning mist came in a long ghostly
beam across his own church into the cloisters on
the garden side. Some bird awakened in the
garden and stabbed the morning silence with a
threnody of unutterable beauty. The fountain
in the garden fell with the tinkle of tiny bells
as though the flowers rang out their morning
hymn, besides which was no sound but the padded
footfall of his own sandals across the misty
church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped, steadying his hand on a stone
bench and loosed the sandals from his own feet,
nor quite knew why he had done it, when a spear
of sunlight struck through the beam of mist
aslant his church; and there on the cot in his
own prayer cell lay the figure of the aged Disciple,
John, in a deep sleep motionless and peaceful as
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Onesimus started back in an amaze that
was neither fear nor horror. It was as if his
own doubts lay before him slain; for the figure
of the woman, clad all in black, was on her knees,
bent over the feet of the Disciple, sobbing. The
air was heavy with the spring hyacinth odor for
the dead, and the weeping woman was breaking
and pouring an alabaster jar of perfumed ointment
over the feet of the Beloved and wiping
them with her fallen hair. As she caught glimpse
of the Bishop standing in the half dark of the cell
arch, she rose and whispered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not dead. He only sleeps. There is no
Death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Thecla’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hath but changed his vesture of flesh for
vesture of Light,” said the Bishop softly. “He
hath gone to the New Heaven and the New Earth
of his Vision. He is not far away. He has fallen
asleep to awaken in the Garden of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So “fell asleep” John, the last of the Disciples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Bishop and the woman rose from
prayer, the freed Greek seaman, and the redeemed
Temple maid and the two beggar children stood
in the cloister arch, waiting to be directed to the
Thecla hospice of the Roman Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop placed his hands on the heads of
the beggar children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suffer little children to come unto Him and
forbid them not,” he said, “for of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven, for our youth shall lead the
whole redeemed world.”</p>

<div><h1 id='p_209'>FOREWORD TO APPENDIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>As a child and later a student, I recall intensely
disliking Paul. I wasn’t quite
sure he was a “crazy fanatic and self-hypnotized
epileptic and self-deceived, unconscious
fakir,” which I have heard teachers of
youth in our colleges call him; terrible views for
a child to hold about a saintly character—I only
set them down to show how wrong teaching can
color our version of the Bible—but I regarded
him as fanatical, narrow, crabbed, sour, domineering,
eager to dragoon men into believing as he did,
whether by fear of Hell-fire, which seemed to
me a cowardly fire-insurance policy against retribution
or by sheer force of will, I had not decided.
I distinctly disliked saints, whose milk of
human kindness had turned sour. Later, years
later, when I came back to read his life in the
sacred records, as I would read with unprejudiced
eyes in the search for facts which we carry to
the reading of an ordinary life, I was amazed
and staggered to find he was a small man, frail
of body, short-sighted, suffering some physical
ailment from the persecutions to which he had
been subjected, fearless as a lion where the faith
was concerned, humble and simple as a child in
other matters, generous in money matters—see
the loan to Philemon—so independent that while
he collected funds for famine in Jerusalem, he
would never touch those funds himself, but supported
himself by the making of tents, for which
there was great demand owing to caravan travel
being universal, and so great of heart that his
tenderness extended to a little slave boy, who
came to him in Rome and who ultimately became
the youngest bishop in the Christian Church
in the third largest city of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time I began reading the Bible as
I would any other book, or a newspaper editorial,
critically but shorn of early beliefs and
prejudices. I read ignoring chapter divisions and
verse divisions, which too often have provided
controversialists with bullets for sharp-shooting
in ambush by wresting sentences from context and
meaning, and using them as “the Devil quotes
Scripture” for his own purposes; and I can conceive
of nothing that will restore belief quicker
than to read the Bible as a historical record of
the birth and growth of a great redemptive force
for humanity—using redemption as a force in
present-day life, not in a far-away, vague shadowy
Kingdom of the Hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time, too, I realized what one of
the greatest American theologians has frankly
admitted—that the worst foes of Christianity are
not its enemies but “the friends in its own house,”
and those foes are sometimes medieval inheritances
of superstitious interpretations, of which
we are unconscious; scraps of misapplied, ignorant
Sunday-School teaching. In fact, I have
often wondered, if secular teaching were given
with as colossal ignorance of historic data as
sacred teaching is given, how many pupils could
pass even a primary examination? How much
would be known of applied science, or even our
own secular historic development? For instance,
how many Bible teachers know that Christ and
John and Paul all quote from the Book of Enoch,
which is variously dated as from 200 to 120
B.C.? How many know that “the camel and
the eye of a needle” was an Arab expression
used to this day? How many know that many
of the expressions precious to the whole world
were quoted by the writers from ancient masters
sacred and secular—such as the reference to
“principalities and powers” separating us from the
love of God? How many realize that “oil out
of the flinty rock” was not a metaphor, but a
fact—such a fact, that modern drillers for petroleum
have found oil in that very spot? How
many know that the fiery furnace recorded in the
book of Daniel to destroy the three young Hebrews
is corroborated by references in the Maccabees
and other ancient books to naphtha waters
which burned with a flame to consume all towards
whom the wind blew, but which had a funneling
air center inside, which left the furnace harmless
in the middle? How many know that tiles
and statuary dug out of the ruins of Babylon show
a man lying unharmed under a lion in the lion’s
den of the king’s royal gardens? We ridicule the
story of Jonah and the whale; yet from the belly
of a stuffed sacred alligator in Egypt amid scraps
of waste paper were taken precious lost records
of the sayings of Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bible is not much longer than seven short
novels. The most of people read seven novels
in a year. The ordinary modern magazine has
the same number of words as a short novel. A
great many people read a magazine from cover
to cover once a week. If the Bible were read
in the same free spirit, unclouded by inherited
prejudice or taint of “creeds,” the return to belief
among youth would be a thing to astound the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why isn’t it so read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>To quote the theologian—because “the literalists”
insist that in the reading, youth shall read
into the context what they dictate rather than
what youth finds of everyday usable livable
truths; and to-day, youth will not be dragooned.
He is going to follow the light of truth as he
finds the light of truth and proves the truth.
He isn’t going to accept one set of opinions on
Sunday, which he finds won’t work out in everyday
life on Monday. Christianity has to be a
workable scheme for every day in the week, or
youth is going to leave the church pews empty
and crowd to “the movies,” to the theater, to the
anarchist lectures, to the wild abandon of joy
in the rhythmic emotional dance; and—youth is
right. With unfettered feet and wings of dawn
to its soul, it faces always the new day. It never
looks backwards. It rejoices in Life; and Christianity
must be put in terms of youth, or preach
to emptier and emptier pews. Paul never ceased
reiterating “Rejoice—rejoice and again I say—rejoice.”
Too often we have clothed a glad and
glorious message in habiliments of age and woe,
which are really the consciousness of past sins
and failures. The Communion is not a Doleful
Supper commemorating a death. It is a Loving
Cup commemorating a wonderful and glad
new birth. The Kingdom of Heaven is not
to-morrow. It is now; or else it is never. And
yet, let us not blame the Middle Age interpretations
shadowy with crime and sorrow. In a carnival
of lust and crime and rapine and sword, the
Middle Age Church preserved and conserved for
humanity, like an oasis of the spirit in a desert
of materialism, all that has helped humanity most,
and this in spite of the fact it foolishly punished
astronomers, who proved the earth round and
burned men who differed by a hair’s breadth
from its “credo.” While it was guilty of these
tragical mistakes of obeying the letter rather
than the spirit—as the Pharisees who crucified
Christ, had done before it—the Middle Age
Church kept the faith for us, inspired and conserved
art, science, letters, in a wilderness of barbarism.
Who encouraged almost sublime architecture?
Who produced paintings that have never
been equaled to this day? Where did Roger
Bacon work out his great, though concealed,
truths of science? In the safety, though it was
the imprisonment, of a friar’s cell. Roger Bacon
(1214-1294), the friar at Oxford, wrote these
words. Were they clairvoyant foresight, or the
superior knowledge of a scientist from facts?
“Ships will go without rowers and with only a
single man to guide them. Carriages without
horses will travel with incredible speed. Machines
for flying can be made in which a man sits.
Machines will raise infinitely great weights.
Bridges will span rivers without supports.” His
superior knowledge was ascribed by his superiors
to Black Magic; but Pope Clement IV supported
him and ordered his knowledge set forth in books,
of which he wrote three in eighteen months without
secretary; but his own immediate superiors
ascribed his marvelous knowledge to communications
from the Devil, and had him imprisoned
for fourteen years. After seven hundred years,
the light of that cell comes out to the world:
yet, the men who suppressed him thought they
were protecting God’s word from assault. It
can only be added that the history of ignorance
repeats itself with surprising persistence. The
good men of his day were simply trying to tie
truth down to the dead line of their own ignorance.
With a charity and a clarity infinite as
the love of God, let us be careful we do not
do the same thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather than condemn the mistakes of the Middle
Age Church from whose darkened and superstitious
interpretations we yet suffer, let us beware
we do not repeat their mistakes by shutting
out the new light of history and archæology and
science, where we should welcome it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christianity does not need to apologize for
itself, or beg the question. When it does that,
he who excuses accuses. When it does that, it
is off the carpet in the modern world. It can
stand on the solid foundation of its own truth.
If that foundation cracks, it will fall as the Holy
City fell before a New Order. Rather than repel
attack, we should welcome it. Attack is the
storm wind that strengthens the hold of the roots
on the eternal rocks. It is the wind that causes
the corn stalk to put out guy ropes above its
roots to hold fast to sure foundation. I love to
read attacks on Christian truth if they are sincere
and not cheap, cynical, ignorant sneers, which
never get anywhere. They force examination of
the certainty of the facts beneath our faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To take but one example of what muddy thinking
has done to stir up shallow waters to make
them look deep—consider the furious and foolish
controversy in the modern church over “miracles.”
“We believe in miracles,” shouts one section of
the Church, “and if you don’t, we’ll see that you
are put out of the church and prove that you are
damned.” “We don’t believe in miracles and we
defy you to put us out of the church; or we’ll
pull down the pillars of youth like Samson as we
go out,” shouts back the other section; and neither
stops to ask in simple clarity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is a miracle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it God breaking, or intervening to prevent,
the effect of His own laws?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no such phenomena in natural life,
and shy back from answering that question in
as bold terms as it is asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or is it the working of a higher law overruling
and annulling a lower law? There are cases of
that in nature, as when the effect of a warm and
constant ocean current is annulled by a cold wind
from the north; but in this case, neither law is
abrogated. We are getting the effects of each;
but the effect of one is stronger than the other.
That might be the meaning of “a miracle”; but
the explanation is so obscure and the workings
so complex and in the unknown, that if that be the
conception of “miracle” we had better not split
the church over it. We are dealing with too many
unknown quantities to postulate with mathematical
certainty what we do know and what we don’t
of fact, or to exclude from fellowship on the
grounds of what is unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or is a miracle a superior knowledge of all
laws and the use of that knowledge to get certain
effects, such as the knowledge of Roger
Bacon, who was seven hundred years in advance
of his time? If that be “miracle,” the controversy
vanishes in thin air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A century ago, if any man had told us we
could see through a man’s flesh and count his
ribs and the joints in his backbone, we would have
called him an unconscious fakir, or a conscious
liar. Yet X-rays have worked that “miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty years ago, if any one had told us we
could go round the world under the sea like
Jonah in the whale’s belly, we would have answered
him in the language of Missouri, “Show
me.” Yet the submarine has worked that
“miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty-five years ago, if any one had predicted
we would course the skies in winged chariots
of which you can read a description in the
First Chapter of Ezekiel, we would have told
him a comic legend about Darius Green and his
flying machine. Yet the aeroplane has worked
that “miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years ago, if some one had told us soberly
and expecting belief that he could talk without
wire or letter from New York with a friend in
Honolulu, we would have had him examined for
his sanity. Yet wireless has worked that “miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impossibility of yesterday is the wonder of
to-day and the commonplace of to-morrow. The
laws of the X-ray, of under-sea navigation in submarine,
of air travel in aeroplane, of wireless
communication, existed just as much and the same
in the days of Christ as they exist to-day; but
men did not know those laws and did not know
how to use them. “Greater works than these
shall ye do,” said the Master. We didn’t believe
Him, though we thought we did; and we witness
the fulfillment of the prophecy. We are heirs to
the fulfillment of the prophecy by the greatest
Master in foresight the world has ever known,
by One who did more to set the human soul free
of the shackles of ignorance and prejudice than
any other leader of all humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, who postulates to-day on what is, or is not,
miraculous, simply writes himself down an ignorant
muddy-brained thinker, stirring up shallow
waters to make them look deep. The “literalist”
in this case simply tries to bind youth down to
“old wives’ fables” and to nursery beliefs. He
tries to level Christian truth down to the dead
line of the most ignorant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so of nearly all the disputes in the Christian
Church—“the resurrection,” “the descent
into Hell,” “the Immaculate Conception,” “the
letter inerrancy of the Scriptures.” Ask definitely
what the controversialist means by his own terms,
and whether agnostic or fundamentalist, instead
of answering you, he backs against the wall of
his “rightness” and hurls thunder bolts of damnation
and excommunication from fellowship at
you; and Youth still goes on its way in laughter
and gladness; and I thank God that it does. It
would be terrible if Christianity ever became as
static and dead as the faith of the Pharisee, who
crucified Christ because He would not conform
to the letter of the law instead of the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We should remember the simple words, “He
will not wrangle.” All Christianity asks is—“prove
all things.” If they don’t prove up, don’t
take them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long ago, a friend had an experience that
illustrates this. For twenty years, she had practically
never read the Bible. She had been taught
the Bible wrong and when the Bob Ingersoll era
came on, ridiculing these vulnerable teachings, she
had quit reading the Bible. As a professor,
who teaches teachers in the largest teachers’
institution in America, once said to me: “Really
I envy you your naïve beliefs! I envy any one
who can believe that old stuff”; she had discarded
the Bible as a book of myths and fairy tales.
She said once “I can’t read it. I simply can’t read
it. I read into it the old impossible prejudices
and creeds I was taught when I was a girl; and
now I know they are not true.” To overcome
that mental habit of reading into the Bible what
isn’t in it, I suggested Weymouth’s translation in
modern phraseology with strictest adherence to
linguistic scholarship. We miss some of the old
and beautiful phrases in this translation, but we
get a translation free of the old controversial
doubtful implied interpretations. She began re-reading
the Bible as she would any other authentic
historic record. In her enthusiasm, she carried
her new treasure to a devout elderly saintly friend
of the old school. The friend sat up in horror.
How dare any one suggest there could be any
improvement in the translation of the Bible.
The good friend was evidently in devout and
blissful self-righteous ignorance of the sources
of the Bible. She evidently did not know that the
Tindale Bible of 1555 was improved in the King
James Version of 1611, and the King James
Version was improved in the 1888 version; and
there are still phrases and words which linguistic
research is improving. And recall that, in old
texts from which the Bible is taken, some of the
old manuscripts did not use the vowel but left
the vowel to be guessed. The good friend—and
she was sincere—mistook the pebbles and the
small rocks of the trail up the slopes of light for
the main foundation and the light ahead; and
promptly began hurling those rocks and pebbles
at a true seeker after light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a case of a saint’s shadow darkening a
seeker’s trail.</p>

<div><h1 id='p_221'>APPENDIX A<br/> <br/> CONCERNING PAUL’S MISSIONARY TOURS<br/> AND DISPUTED POINTS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Christian religion takes its stand
upon the ground of history,” says
Malden in his <span class='it'>Problems of the New
Testament</span>; “but there is now a feeling abroad
that the authority of the New Testament has
been severely shaken by recent studies, if it is
not in danger of being destroyed outright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen years ago, such a statement would have
been acknowledged as voicing general sentiment,
not to be denied; and the liberal wing of scholars
would have regarded the statement as grounds
for relegating the New Testament in history to
the junk heap of picturesque myths, in which there
was, of course, some dim reflex of events that had
happened, but so embroidered by superstition as
to be utterly untrustworthy as a basis for belief
founded on facts; while the literalists would have
regarded the same general sentiment as grounds
for blind belief, for dogmas to embody their blind
belief, to which all Christians must subscribe,
or be cast out. Indeed, the most excited and
least informed of the literalists would have gone
even farther as late as 1922—they would have
passed laws prohibiting free speech, free thought,
the teaching of any brand of belief but their
own. The panic reiteration of dogma was a sad
evidence of lack of faith in the truth beneath
their own beliefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truth needs no bludgeon of civil law or religious
threat of exclusion. All it needs is to be
put forth with its proofs. He who seeks to establish
his own beliefs by disproving some one else’s—is
wasting precious time. Truth needs only
that its torch be held high aloft lighting the way,
and humanity will follow; and the dark illusion
called error will vanish as darkness always disperses
before light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the War has come a subtle change.
The change of front is something deeper than
a complete collapse of the scheme on which our
civilization seemed founded. It is a something
deeper than the fear of death that took such
awful toll in the War. It is deeper than a panic
stampede from the impasse of our own former
conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a determination to get at basic truths and
with them rebuild a better civilization. Even if
we have to proceed slowly step by step as up a
steep trail of rolling stones to higher outlook,
we are determined to eliminate error and get at
truth, on which we’ll found our faith for the
morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The War only hastened a tendency that had
been ripening for half a century. It opened doors
long closed in the East to linguistic scholars, to
archæologist’s spade, to such purely secular scientific
expeditions as the American expedition to
the deserts of Tartary and Mongolia to find if
the original home of mankind and prehistoric life
were really in Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men and women back from the horrors of
War somehow vaguely realized that dogmatic
religion had not prevented a hideous throwback
of civilization to the practices of barbarism. They
discovered with horror civilization was only skin
deep; and while some came back with hopeless
fears that science, in submarine and aeroplane
and poisonous gases and armaments of long-range
devilish powers undreamed as possible, seemed
to have created a monster that would devour
civilization, like the destruction of the fabled
Atlantis, others came back with a deeper insight.
While science had created the monsters of destruction,
it had also discovered the angels of
mercy in surgery, in aeroplane, in wireless, that
seemed almost to rend the veil into the unseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So humanity came back from the War seeking
foundations for belief in truth facts—sifting error
from truth, proving all things, and holding fast
only to what it could prove and use; and neither
science nor religion asks any other criterion—“Try
it; if it works, take it: if it doesn’t, don’t”;
and the latest scholarship declares bluntly Christianity
takes its stand on the ground of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Onesimus will be found in outline
in the letter to Philemon. Though Rome had
neither Titus’ Triumphant Arch, nor Vespasian’s
magnificent colosseum, when Paul was prisoner
in the hut near the Three Taverns, one can reconstruct
from Josephus and from the Roman
historians of the period the character of the Rome
in which the young Phrygian slave found himself
enmeshed, and how Paul lived with the radiance
of a quenchless diamond amid the cesspool slime
of a great imperial city in the first stages of its
moral decay. How great and hideous was that
moral decay could not be told in a book going
through the mails. Hints of it can be found in
Philostratus’ <span class='it'>Apollonius</span> (Oxford, 1912). The
references to Nero need no proof. They are
well-known history; and if space permitted, the
letters, true or false, of Paul and Seneca could
be given. These letters can be found in the Apocryphal
Books of the New Testament, on which
Malden (Oxford), Turner (Oxford), Sir William
Ramsay and Bishop Lightfoot have given
the latest best views. At first, my impression
was Onesimus might have been a colored slave
like the Apostle later known as “Niger,” but
on looking up the past history of the Phrygian
mountain clans, it was easy to see how the constant
raids of robber bands from upper Galilee
to kidnap the mountain boys and girls and sell
them as slaves in the cities of the Roman Road,
might have produced a character like Onesimus,
and that he was pure Greek. To this day, the
Druse descendants of these mountain clans have
resisted all enslavement. If captured and reduced
to servitude, they become fanatic demons
of crime. If left free, they preserve a peculiarly
pure form of Christian belief, though primitive
and superstitious. Felix’s part in clearing out
the robber bands of Galilee is also history and
can be found fully given in Josephus though
too often when he rescued the kidnapped victims,
it was to resell them to enrich himself. The
jealousy between the sisters—Drusilla and Bernice—is
also given in Josephus. The fact that
Felix, who had once been slave himself, rose to
marry the royal and proud line of the Herods
attests a character of peculiar force. The scene
in the Cæsarean Judgment Hall will be found
given in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, and still more fully in Josephus.
Of later authorities on Paul, besides Malden and
Lightfoot, are Robinson of Cambridge, Rendell
Harris in his volumes of 1893 and 1911, Parry
of Cambridge, 1920, Smith, 1919, and Kersopp
Lake in 1916. Students wishing to trace back
these modern authorities to the ancients and
nearer contemporaries of Paul will find the references
in these volumes leading them back to Clement
and Ignatius and Iræneus and hosts of others.
The name of Paul’s custodian on the ship wrecked
en route to Rome is variously spelled, but I have
followed the spelling of the <span class='it'>Acts</span>. The same
name is again found in the fall of the Holy City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Church historians have been very severe on
Bernice, who became a character famous or infamous—as
you will—in Titus’ day in Rome.
Her angling to ensnare the Emperor, who was
a young general at the time, became a joke in
the Roman theaters, but would judgments be so
severe, I wonder, if censors looked up the age
at which this child was married to her first husband,
and then to silence evil gossip about the
affection between herself and her brother, was
married to a second aged husband whom she at
once left? She could not have been more than
seventeen or eighteen, when married to the second
husband. All the Herods notoriously married
off their daughters and sisters to strengthen
their own insecure thrones. Women were a pawn
for empire; and I, for one, would hate to cast
a stone at a girl of eighteen, who when she found
herself a pawn between lust and power, if she
had to pawn herself, aimed at the highest bidder.
The name of Bernice’s second husband from
whom she fled—Polemo or Polemon—should be
noted carefully; for it comes again in the story of
Thecla. The royal Roman lady, a relative of
the Emperor, was either wife or daughter of this
ancient satyr, and her sympathy for Thecla may
have arisen from her own similar experiences.
<span class='it'>Apollonius’ Life</span> gives the brand of the man’s
vices. Young Agrippa, the last of the Herod
line, while too weak to master circumstances and
rule with the iron ruthless hand of Herod the
Great, was undoubtedly the most decent of all
the evil Herods, and his character as portrayed
by Josephus, hardly bears out the evil insinuations
of the Jews, who mobbed and would have murdered
both him and his sister. Paul’s opinion
of the young man, we get in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, and
Agrippa’s reaction to that appeal does not bear
out proof of a degenerate youth. “Almost,”
says the boyish prince, he could not have been
much over twenty, “you would make me a Christian.”
All that is merely hinted here of the
Daphne Gardens is mild compared to the truth
that can be found in any Roman record of the day.
The lure of the Daphne Gardens drew many Romans
to spend the winter at Antioch, with fatal
results to the morale of officers and governors;
and after the fall of Jerusalem compelled the
change of the headquarters of the Christian church
from Antioch to Ephesus. The best testimony to
the influence of the new faith in counteracting the
evil of those Gardens is found in the charges and
countercharges when the temples were destroyed,
that the Christians had burned them. It was not
with earthly fires they had burned them but with
the divine fires of the faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one secular account of the return of the
Roman troops after the sack of Jerusalem will
be found mention of a shipwreck almost similar
to that which overtook Paul on his journey to
Rome; and in early Grecian statuary and pottery
will be found ships “trussed” or “frapped”
by ropes to keep the timbers from going to pieces
just as recorded in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>. Lucian’s history
describes the corn ships of the period; and Josephus’
account of a wreck is an exact parallel
of Paul’s experiences, except that Josephus’ ship
carried six hundred passengers. “Corn,” it need
hardly be told here, was not our modern corn
but such grains as wheat and barley. Palestine
is now known to have been the original area of
the first wheat cultivated in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One very pointed question occurs here. Where
Josephus refers to Christ, his words are: “<span class='it'>Now
there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if
it is lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer
of wonderful works .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was the Christ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<p class='pindent'>And he hints that the destruction of Jerusalem
was divine chastisement for the murder of James,
the disciple. His words are: “The brother of
Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was
James .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he (Herod) delivered to be stoned.”
Luke’s account of this in the <span class='it'>Acts</span> is: “Herod
the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain
of the church; and killed James, the brother
of John, with the sword.” The two accounts
do not seem to agree, but recall all men wore
swords in these days, even the disciples—see the
cutting of Malchus’ servant’s ear—and in a
rabble stoning a man to death both accounts may
be true. That being Josephus’ belief, why did
he not refer more frankly to Christ as the Messiah
of Jewish expectation? That has been a
puzzling question that has cast discredit on Josephus
as historian of the Roman era. Yet it
would not cast discredit on him if one paused
to examine the circumstances under which his
history was written. He had been a Pharisee of
the Pharisees, in the best sense, and a Zealot of
the Zealots for the defence of Hebrew rights; but
when he saw that Judea had not a chance on earth
against Roman power—that Rome could give
order and law where the Hebrews, themselves,
could not, like Isaiah before him, he counseled
coöperation with the strong power rather than the
opposition that would inevitably end in national
extinction. In the siege of Jerusalem, like
Agrippa, he went over to the Roman side against
the lawless robber bands, who held and plundered
the Holy City. He did everything in his power to
save the city from total destruction by imploring
its surrender till he was stoned away by the fighters
on the walls. When the Holy City was conquered
and totally destroyed but for the Herod
Towers on the west, he was taken to Rome and
given quarters in the royal palace, and wrote his
record of the Roman era in Palestine for Titus
and Vespasian, as their guest and pensioner. As
historian in an era when emperor worship was
being set up by Rome throughout the Empire, he
could hardly issue an official history under Roman
approval that acknowledged Pilate, the Roman
governor, had crucified, at the behest of the Jews,
the unacknowledged Messiah. We wish for his
own sake he had frankly given record of the
Christ, whose career he must have known in detail
in a land not much larger than Vermont, or
say, about a hundred and seventy-five miles long
by sixty broad, which was the area of the Jewish
Palestine in his day. He gives full record of all
the High Priests and the Sanhedrim to the cutting
of their throats in the Aqueduct twenty-five years
after Christ’s death. He was in and about Jerusalem
during the most of Christ’s life. Familiar
with every foot of Palestine, that life he must
have known; but he is silent because he was the
pensioner of the government that had consented
to Christ’s death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Paul and Josephus and Apollos must have
known one another is self-evident. Each was a
great student of the law and of philosophy. Each
was familiar with the studies of the great philosophies
of Alexandria. Paul quotes from them
continually. Paul and Josephus had both studied
in Jerusalem. Paul and Apollos had both spent
their boyhood in Tarsus. Apollos seems to have
been the richest of the three, and a traveled gnostic.
Josephus was soldier till he laid down arms
in Jerusalem to become historian in Rome, and he
was a liberal Pharisee. Paul was fanatical student
of the Hebrew law till he became follower of
Christ. That Paul was tentmaker did not place a
social chasm between him and the other two; for
every Hebrew boy had to learn a trade to forefend
against want in perilous times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solely because it would require a library of
books to give the corroborative data of Paul’s
life in Rome and in Cæsarea, the data bearing on
Onesimus’s story must here be condensed to notes
for reference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spring Festival in the Roman Empire occurred
at almost the same period of the year as
the Jewish Passover and the Christian crucifixion;
so that the tortures inflicted on Christ and the
later Christian martyrs at this period were really
to glut the lust for blood that was part of the old
pagan worship. Free gifts for charity to the mob
had degenerated into a bribe to the populace in
place of justice. Rome was no longer Roman.
It was a composite of the known world. Though
Rome gave her Empire good laws and stable government,
as Apollonius, the sage, pointed out to
the General, Vespasian, she could not ensure the
execution of those laws for two reasons: if she
appointed local governors or kings, like the
Herods, to hold loyalty, she could not prevent
them exacting extortionate taxes for their own
wealth; if she appointed Roman governors like
Pilate, they could not speak the languages of the
far-flung provinces and had to depend on underlings
of native birth, who perverted Roman justice.
The Roman Empire was falling to pieces from
over-extension. Democracy was degenerating to
mobocracy and mobocracy to the tyranny of the
Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would the old Idumean guard have been executed
for the loss of his prisoner in the shipwreck?
He most certainly would; for Rome was as ruthless
to her own, as to her provincials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object in kidnapping a beautiful slave can
be found in the four lives that have been written
of Apollonius. We sometimes despair of the
world because religion seems to have done so little
to change men. The despair is the voice of unbelief.
Read the old records. The tortures of
Thecla were mild compared to the martyrdom of
many a Christian in the pleasure gardens of Nero,
where the victims were dipped in oil and then
tied to stakes, as torches, in ridicule of the claim
that they were the torch bearers of light and
glad news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rome standing for irresistible brute power, was
ever jealous of the cultured Greeks; and the
Greeks returned scorn for scorn—which would
explain why Onesimus, a Greek runaway, was
friendless in Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time of Paul’s first imprisonment, 63-64
A.D., Nero’s madness was acknowledged in
Rome. The great fire, of which Paul and Seneca
corresponded, took place in 64 A.D., but Rome,
rolling in wealth and luxury, did not want to upset
prosperity by destroying good times; and only
after Nero’s suicide and three years of turbulence,
when the Army loomed as a terrible menace,
was Vespasian, the strong general, called to become
Emperor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding the Three Taverns, all through the
Empire at this time, the keepers of the wine shops
were women; and in the East, they were called
Rahabs—a name with evil import to us to-day;
but all the Rahabs were not harpies—as witness
the Rahab of Jericho in Joshua’s day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuller details of the equinoctial gales at Crete
will be given on the chapter on Apollos and John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Malta, or Melita, is St. Paul’s Bay, to this
day commemorating the site of his landing and
shipwreck, just as Lud gave London its name,
and the myth of Lud points back to a personality
behind the myth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The songs of the Arabs are the same to-day as
in Paul’s time and can be found in Newman’s
<span class='it'>Babylon and Nineveh</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole story of the gladiatorial combat in
Cæsarea, to which old Julius refers, will be found
in Josephus. Both sides fought till the arena
swam in blood to the ankles, and of one side not
a man was left alive. Other victor slaves were
given their freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Felix, like Herod the Great, tried to clean out
the robber bands from the caves of Galilee; but
Felix was charged with selling the rescued victims
as slaves to accumulate a fortune for himself,
though he had, himself, been slave. This can
all be found in Josephus with the full story of the
Herod family and their perplexing intermarriages
and repudiations of marriages. Bernice’s flight
from her old husband was by pretense a religious
vow, but openly in the theater of Rome, she was
twitted with taking the vow to escape her spouse.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Titus, Vespasian’s son, not yet thirty, will be
more fully described in the chapter on the fall of
Jerusalem. Keep him distinct in your mind from
Titus, the Greek evangelist of Crete, who became
Bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philemon, the merchant of Colossé, Paul’s
friend, was converted to the new faith in Corinth
or Athens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who were “the friends in Cæsar’s household”
of whom Paul wrote? Bishop Lightfoot shows
of the forty-three Christianized Jews and Greeks,
who met Paul when he reached Rome, and whose
names may be found in the letter to the Romans;
many were in Roman governmental positions of
trust. Their names can be found scattered
through the <span class='it'>Acts</span> and the apostolic letters to Rome
and Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seems almost no reason to doubt that the
great Epaphroditus, the Greek lover of learning,
to whom Josephus dedicated his volume, was the
same benevolent Greek of Philippi who supplied
Paul with money for his needs in Rome, and who
carried Paul’s letter to the Philippians, and who
seems to have been under surveillance with Paul
in Rome; for in Rome, even if his eyesight would
have permitted Paul to follow his mechanical
means of supporting himself by tentmaking, there
was not the same demand as in the East for tents
for desert travel, or in Greece for maritime sailcloth.
Aquila and Priscilla, who came later in the
Apollos story, like Paul, were tentmakers. Paul’s
knowledge of seafaring was gained as sailcloth
maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always when religious faith wanes, necromancy,
clairvoyance, sorcery thrive. The Old World
with its dying faiths both Roman and Grecian,
was now overrun with sorcerers of every description,
practising wonder-working and miracles by
methods variously known as Black Magic and
White Magic. The knowledge of the methods
underlying these powers was undoubtedly drawn
from India and Persia. Some workers were good
and some were bad. Some miracles were fraudulent
and some were undoubtedly genuine—using
the word “miracle” in the sense of wonder-working;
only the Christians, the Essenes, the
Gnostics, the Nazarenes refused to work these
wonders for profit. For some reason or other,
probably because they had lost faith in God, and
learned magic from the Persians and the Babylonians,
the Jews had become great sorcerers in
Paul’s day. More will be given of this in the
chapter on Apollos. It is given also in the Acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reference of Onesimus to the luminous
look, or radiance round Paul in the half dark, and
the old Idumean’s legend of Antioch’s invading
soldiers finding nothing in the Holy of Holies
of the Temple between the Cherubim and Seraphim
but a little thin blue flame, would have been
laughed out of any court of evidence by science
ten years ago. Not so to-day. The study of
wireless waves is opening the door to the wonder-world
of these waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The caution to Timothy as the old soldier put
it, “to beware the widows,” and Paul’s somewhat
severe injunctions regarding women to the
churches of Ephesus and Corinth arose from great
trouble from the activities of two women called
Euodias and Syntyche, of whom nothing more is
known than that they were quarreling in the
church of Clement at Philippi, who wrote some of
the finest and most universally accepted Epistles,
which are <span class='it'>not</span> in the New Testament. Clement
will be quoted later. He was Bishop of Rome
about the time John “fell asleep.” Turner, one of
the most critical of the higher critics, in his studies
on <span class='it'>Early Church History</span>, explains why Clement’s
<span class='it'>Letters</span> are not in our New Testament. They
were not disinterred from Alexandria till 1628,
when they were sent in a present to Charles I,
which was seventeen years after the <span class='it'>King James
Version</span> came out. Any one who wants to follow
up how desperately dissatisfied the King James
translators felt with their work, should read the
<span class='it'>Journals of Evelyn</span>, a most devout churchman, on
his conversation with the survivors among the
translators. Such letters as Clement’s should be in
supplementary readers in every Sunday School and
Church in the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Paul seems to have been prisoner in
Rome for certainly two years, and before coming
to Rome, prisoner in Cæsarea for at least as long,
he was not without friends in both places. Philip’s
four daughters, who were prophetesses or teachers,
resided in Cæsarea; and Paul seems to have
had great latitude in seeing his friends. This was
because he was not only a Jew but a Roman
citizen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency of modern scholarship is to regard
Luke, the physician, as “the man from
Macedonia,” who begged for help. The Greek
scholar is supposed to have accompanied Paul as
medical helper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Onesimus left Rome carrying the personal
letter to Philemon, in 64 A.D. or thereabouts,
he also carried along with one Tychicus
the circular letter to the Colossians. These facts
can be found in the postscript to the Epistles,
which ought rather to be called simply Letters
with advice for the guidance of the Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>Philemon Letter</span>, I have followed the
Weymouth translation, rather than the <span class='it'>King
James Version</span>, or the <span class='it'>Revised Version</span>. In fact,
I had read Philemon in the old versions many
times before I saw its beauty. Then one day, I
happened to read it in Spanish, and the old message
in a new language of peculiarly graphic
imagery shocked me into a visualization of the
picture—the old fighter down and out in chains
awaiting death, the slave running to him for
safety, and the crippled prisoner pleading for, not
his own, but the boy’s freedom. Then, I hunted
up the best modern translation I could get—which
was Weymouth’s; and the picture struck me as
one of the most pathetic and beautiful recorded
in the <span class='it'>New Testament</span>. No longer I saw Paul
as the hunter of heretics, the fanatical convert,
the tireless preacher of a new creed, but as a little
old man in chains waiting for the headsman’s axe
and writing to Timothy: “I am now ready to be
offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith.” This was before
his second trial. Then there follow the sad brave
lines, “Demas hath forsaken me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only Luke
is with me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At my first answer no man stood
with me, but all men forsook me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Lord
stood with me and strengthened me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was
delivered out of the mouth of the lion.” In other
words, they could not throw Paul to the wild
beasts because he claimed his Roman citizenship;
so they slew him with the headsman’s axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How do we know Onesimus was a mere boy,
when with Paul in Rome? This question will be
answered fully in the chapter on John and Apollos.
Suffice to say, Rome had such a surplus of
slaves from conquest—there were more than
30,000 Jews enslaved after the fall of Jerusalem
in 70 A.D.—that only those between the ages of
eighteen and thirty were considered of the slightest
monetary value. Past thirty, they had either
won their freedom in war, in gladiatorial combat,
by purchase, or had been “worked out” and relegated
to the mines, or the farm plantations, or the
galley ships, to die. Onesimus would not have
been worth passage money back to Philemon, if
he had been old. The value of a slave had fallen
to $18 of modern money at this time. Human
life was the cheapest and least sacred thing in the
world market. Slavery was the dry rot eating
away the underpinnings of the Roman Empire;
for while, of a population of a million and a half
in Rome at this time, a tenth of the people rolled
in a luxury undreamed before or since, that tenth
lived by sapping the life blood of the slave hordes,
who numbered in Rome alone, almost a million of
the populace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The theater and judgment hall at Cæsarea,
where Paul pleaded his case before the young
Herod rulers, are fully described in Josephus, or
in such modern works as have already been mentioned,
or in Dr. Taylor’s <span class='it'>Paul</span> (1881). The
city, itself, was reputed to have a population of
200,000; but it was detested by the Jews and
chiefly peopled by Greeks, Phœnicians, Romans,
and the riff-raff of Rome’s Asiatic world. Jerusalem
was to the Jew the Holy City but
Cæsarea was the city of the conqueror. Here
were held the carnivals, the free feasts, the races
where the chariot wheels wore grooves in the
stones, the gladiatorial combats, the torture of
prisoners, the wild-beast combats, and all the
hippodrome exhibitions by which Rome tried to
hold the populace loyal. Josephus gives a description
of the Herod here who had caused the
death of James, the great scene in the judgment
hall, when the Herod, who was Bernice’s first
husband, appeared in coat of silver mail; how the
owl flying in was observed as an omen of ill; and
the King fell in a fit of apoplexy either from overeating
or intestinal troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Paul and Peter perished in Rome,
more than nine Christian bishops had been tortured
in the public forums and relegated as broken
wrecks to the mines. All these details will be
found in the authorities already quoted.</p>

<div><h1 id='p_242'>APPENDIX B<br/> <br/> OLD DOCUMENTS AND MODERN VIEWS<br/> ON THE HEROD FAMILY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The many disputed points preceding the
fall of the Holy City do not enter into
this story; but as many students may care
to follow up the history for themselves, the facts
of the case with the pros and cons may be set
forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was the Apollos of Paul’s letters the same as
Apollonius the great sage of Asia Minor, variously
known as a reformer, a gnostic, a mystic,
but refusing to ally himself with any government
or any church? The early Fathers’ antagonism
to the Gnostics was so bitter that a record of it
would fill many volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The New Testament references to Apollos may
be counted on one hand. We hear of him first in
the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, date about 54 A.D., “And a certain Jew
named Apollos born at Alexandria, an eloquent
man and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
This man was instructed in the way of the
Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and
taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing
only the baptism of John. And he began to speak
boldly in the synagogue; whom when Aquila and
Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them and
expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
And when he was disposed to pass into
Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples
to receive him; who, when he was come, helped
them much which had believed through grace: for
he mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly,
shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
And it came to pass that while Apollos was at
Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper
coasts, came to Ephesus.” These words are
written by Luke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We next find Paul writing to the Corinthians
from Philippi about 59 A.D., “Every one of you
saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of
Cephas; and I of Christ.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For while one
saith, I am of Paul and another, I am of Apollos;
are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is
Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the increase.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Therefore let no man
glory in men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and these things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have transferred
to myself and to Apollos for your sakes.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly
desired him to come unto you with the brethren;
but his will was not to come at this time; but he
will come when he shall have convenient time.”
Then in a letter to Titus, now Bishop of Crete,
about 65 A.D., Paul begs Titus to bring “Zenas
the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,
that nothing be wanting unto them.” Titus, it
should be added, was a Greek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is practically all that is said of Apollos,
Paul’s coworker, in the <span class='it'>New Testament</span>, except
that in one of the early Luke manuscripts on the
<span class='it'>Acts</span>, Apollos is given as Apollonius; see Turner’s
<span class='it'>Early Church History</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Ignatius’ letter to the Magnesians, there is
a reference to Apollonius as a presbyter in the
Asiatic Greek Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many authorities, among them Luther, considered
that this Apollos wrote the <span class='it'>Hebrews</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to Apollonius, the Gnostic and Sage of
Cappadocia, he shunned fame and the populace to
such an extent, though a temple was built and
named after him by a collateral descendant of the
same family as rescued Thecla, no authentic life of
Apollonius was written till many years after his activities
had ceased. It is his misfortune that the
legends of his life and letters, which had passed
into the hands of the Emperor Hadrian, were
handled by a supercilious court hanger-on, a Greek
writer, who knew nothing of the Gnostics and less
of the Christians, and would have considered
either beneath his notice if he had known. Apollonius’
biographer was Philostratus; and though
there are constant references to him in early writings
as a reformer, a revivalist, a miracle or magic-worker,
no other authoritative life of him has been
given than Philostratus’, drawn from notes compiled
by Damis, Apollonius’ secretary. He seemed
to have aroused as violent controversies in his lifetime
as since his death. His learning and piety, no
one disputed. His purity of life was known from
India to Rome. He was born rich and deeded
his property over to his brother and his poor relatives.
Yet so great was the veneration of the
populace and royalty for him, wherever he went
he lacked naught and traveled in great estate. He
was born at Tyana sometime just before or after
the birth of Christ; but like Paul born at Tarsus,
he might still have been a Grecian Jew; and having
studied in Egypt, when young, his birthplace
might easily have been confused as Alexandria.
By one class he was regarded as “a sorcerer,” “a
quack,” “a bonesetter in religion”; by another
class, as a miracle-worker and great revivalist; but
we must not forget that the Greeks first called
Paul “a beggarly babbler.” He had the gift of
clairvoyance or prophecy, and foretold the famine
mentioned in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, the murder of Domitian,
and many other events of the period. In his public
addresses, he quoted repeatedly the language
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul—in
fact, nine such phrases can be picked out of Philostratus’
<span class='it'>Life of Apollonius</span>—to my mind one of
the most striking being where he speaks of “seeing
through a glass darkly”—which his enemies called
the superstition of crystal gazing. Origen thought
him a sorcerer. Eusebius called him a philosopher,
and in legend he became in Greek-Asia a sort
of St. George, or St. Patrick. He was known to
have been in Ephesus, Corinth and Crete from
60 to 65 A.D. Like Paul, he had studied in
Tarsus. At sixteen, he became a vegetarian or
wandering evangelist, like the Essenes. He undoubtedly
possessed the power of healing and refused
all gifts for it. At Daphne Gardens, he
incurred enmity by calling the men “brute beasts.”
His lodging was always in the temples. He
seemed to prefer to preach in the pagan temples,
either because he would be sure of a large audience,
or secure from interruption, or to find people
whose spirits were blindly reaching for God.
He studied in Egypt, Ethiopia, India and Persia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of translations of his life there have been
many, Berwick’s one of the earliest English,
Phillimore’s, Mead’s and Flinders Petrie’s, the
best of the latest. Phillimore’s is bitter towards
other translators. Mead’s would, of course, be
biased as both Gnostic and Theosophic; but
Flinders Petrie’s can hardly be accused of any bias
but scholarship. Thanks to Flinders Petrie, the
details of Apollonius’ life are now known more
fully than any other Apostle except Paul. There
are still differences as to certain dates, but roughly,
I think the following dates are accepted by the
majority of scholars. Please compare with Paul’s
letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Born 4 or 6 B.C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tarsus 11 A.D. as a student.</p>

<p class='pindent'>16 to 21 A.D. under the discipline of speechless
silence traveling through Asia Minor and the
East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>23 to 43 A.D. teaching, preaching, studying in
Antioch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>43 to 45 A.D. India and Persia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>45 to 46 A.D. Crete, Sparta, Athens, Corinth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>46 to 59 A.D. unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>59 to 65 A.D. Corinth, Ephesus, Crete, Greek
Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>66 to 68 A.D. Greece, Rome, Spain, Africa,
Sicily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>69 A.D. Egypt and Alexandria and Phœnicia
and Antioch and the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>83 A.D. Ephesus and Crete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere here he suffered trial for disrespect
to Emperors; a most dramatic story as given by
Phillimore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>83 to 96 A.D. preaching and teaching in Ephesus
and Crete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had reached the age of a century, he
disappeared in Crete as told in a later chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where Paul went out for the Gentiles to call
sinners to repentance, and Peter seems to have
gone among the dispersed Jews of the Euphrates
and Rome, Apollos went forth to call “the righteous”
to repentance; and from the records of the
times, the call to the sod-bound “righteous”
seemed as badly needed as the call to the sinners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now whether Apollos were Apollonius, I do
not know. They lived in the period in the same
places. For fiction purposes to throw the flashlight
on the conditions under which the Apostles
labored, it does not matter; but granted he may
have been, isn’t there a dilemma in having him
East of the Dead Sea, on his way back from the
Far East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Didn’t Apollonius, according to the legendary
life of him, come back from India by the Red Sea
to Egypt? Didn’t he meet Vespasian in Alexandria;
and wasn’t he sent by Vespasian on an
errand to Tarsus, North of Palestine? How
then, would he go East of the Dead Sea towards
Damascus? Fiction could brush these questions
aside as immaterial in a story; but it does not
need to. From 66 to 70, every port in Egypt,
Palestine and Grecian Asia was packed with the
Roman Armies hurrying to crush Jerusalem.
Christians had already hurried east of the Jordan
and Dead Sea to hide in the caves of the desert
as Christ had warned them to do, when he foretold
the destruction of the Holy City. Travelers
from the Far East to Grecian Asia had to follow
the Damascus Road; for they could not safely
venture in the war zone of the Coast and Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How do we know Peter was in Babylonia? Because
he says so in one of his letters. Critics say
the Babylonia he mentions is really Rome. I
leave that dispute wide open. There is no proof
Paul and Peter were together in Rome, when the
former was executed. Paul’s death is given
variously as between 67 and 69 A.D. Note
John’s references in the <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span> to “the two
witnesses” in the other world! If Peter hastened
from the Euphrates to take up the work of Paul’s
dispersed followers in Rome—and there is no
proof of Peter being elsewhere in these years—he
must have hastened for Rome almost contemporaneous
with the revolt that ended in the overthrow
of Jerusalem; for his death by crucifixion
took place soon after Paul’s. Onesimus’ trip to
Peter in the East is, of course, pure fiction, for
Peter’s first round-robin letter to the churches of
Asia was sent by Silvanus, a friend of Paul; and
very few details are known of the second letter.
They are dated 60 to 66 A.D. The Vatican books
in this period are invaluable to all students of
early Christianity. They reject ruthlessly all fabulous
stories. See “Pope’s Aids to the Bible,”
Vol. II; and Fouard’s “St. Peter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How do I infer that in the siege of Jerusalem
the Herod women were sent for safety to the
Herod Fort east of the Dead Sea instead of
west? First, because the Herod Fort on the west
side of the Dead Sea was in the hands of the
rabble zealots and bandits, and was therefore
against Rome and the Herods. It was one of the
first forts to be reduced after Jerusalem. Second,
because the Herod Fort east of the Dead Sea
was always an arsenal of defence against revolt
and against the invasion of Arab and Idumean
from the east. Here, the Herods had their family
country place in distinction from the Palace in
Jerusalem and from the public buildings in
Cæsarea on the sea. Here, Herod the Great
entertained Cleopatra and spurned her blandishments.
Here, the Herods retired with their
families for family conference and often for the
most terrible crimes known in family history. It
was a secret fort. Here were the sulphur baths.
Near Jericho were their pleasure gardens. Here,
it is now almost universally agreed, John Baptist
was imprisoned and executed; and Herod the
Great passed the hideous days preceding his
hideous death. I can’t prove it was where they
were kept for safety during the siege of Jerusalem;
but it does not seem to me there was any
other place where they could have been safely
kept; for Cæsarea was in wild disorder. Bernice
had gone down to Jerusalem from her old spouse
in Syria to lay her plans for Titus, the Roman
general; but as far as we know until the end, she
was not in the siege. Agrippa was with the
Roman forces throughout. Herodias’ madness
and remorse can be found in her banished husband’s
letters. The final fate of the last of the
Herods beneath Vesuvius’ eruption can be found
in Josephus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letters from Pilate to Herod, from Herod to
Pilate, give the data as to Herodias’ blindness.
In these letters, Herodias’ daughter is referred
to as a younger Herodias, not as Salome. Therefore
I left Salome out of these stories. The fiction
woven about Salome’s name in modern literature
seems to me the most perfect example of sensualizing
and degrading biblical records that could be
devised. The most cursory glance at the Herod
family tree show she must have been little more
than a baby at the time of the Baptist’s death—certainly
under eight or ten. When you consider
the colossal pyramid of unclean modern literature
and music built on Salome’s name, it isn’t much of
a testimony to the modern heart being much
cleaner than the Herod heart which we condemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The superstition of the flower foretelling the
lovers’ fate, which has come down to our own
day in the petals of the field daisy, dates back to
the very lotus flower worship of India and Egypt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legendary “Ardath, the Field of Flowers”
is, of course, from the Persian and will be found in
the <span class='it'>Book of Esdras</span>. In fact, to understand this
whole era, no student should fail to read <span class='it'>Esdras</span>
and <span class='it'>Enoch</span>, which are parallel in writing and sentiment
to <span class='it'>Daniel</span> and <span class='it'>Revelation</span>. Pilate’s fate
and letters will be found in the <span class='it'>Apocryphal New
Testament</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malden thinks from Paul’s letters to the people
of Thessaly 54 A.D. that, up to the assault on
Jerusalem in 69-70, many of the Christians still
looked for Christ’s second coming in glory and
majesty and power; but in the letter to Cornith,
when Paul had drawn his immortal picture of “the
celestial body,” it is evident the Christians knew
they were working for and in an Invisible Kingdom
such as Onesimus described. Malden gives the
correct chronology in which the books of the New
Testament were written; so that one can follow
the fuller and higher and closer outlook the workers
were attaining of their own mission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Details on the trails down to the Jordan at this
time can be found in Josephus, or Thomson’s
famous <span class='it'>Land and the Book</span>. There is a full description
of Machærus Fort in Thomson also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to note that the Roman Consul,
who befriended Paul at Corinth in the days of his
work with Apollos, was Junius Galleo, a relative
of Seneca’s, which seems to bear out that Paul
and Seneca knew each other in Rome. In this
period before Paul’s death, Burrhus, Nero’s
handy man, was sent again and again on messages
from the Jews of Cæsarea and Ephesus to
Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was Mariamne, Herod the Great’s proud
wife, murdered by him? Her tomb has recently

<div><h1 id='p_253'>APPENDIX C<br/> <br/> THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FALL OF<br/> JERUSALEM AND THE BREAKING UP<br/> OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The fall of Jerusalem was of deeper,
subtler significance than the surrender of
any one of the countless cities which were
subject to Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rome had passed through a few years of terrible
turbulence after Nero’s suicide in 68. When
Vespasian, the steady-headed general with the
Army’s strength and loyalty behind him, surged
to the crest of the turbulence as Emperor in 69,
Rome realized in order to stabilize her entire
Empire, she must crush rebellion or revolution
wherever found. If one city like Jerusalem, or
one little province like Judea not much larger than
Vermont or New Hampshire, could defy Roman
power, all the Eastern provinces would flame in
revolt; and there were certain considerations that
particularly embittered the Romans towards the
Jews. From at least thirty or forty years before
the birth of Christ, the Jews of Jerusalem had
been granted special privileges by the Roman
Senate. They were allowed freely to exercise
their own peculiar religious rites. Their huge
temple revenues from Jews in every part of the
world were left untouched by Rome. Though a
head tax had been imposed from the days of the
census in Christ’s boyhood—supposed not to have
exceeded from fifty to sixty cents of modern
money—the Jews paid no other tributary taxes
to Rome. Certain seaport towns, from the borders
of Egypt in the south to Asia Minor on the
north, seemed to have paid some sort of municipal
tax in excise, which went to the members of the
local rulers like the Herod family as a personal
revenue or bride’s dowry; and yet all local rulers
amassed colossal fortunes. How did they do it?
By the perversion of justice. While the Jews had
their own courts dominated by high priests, these
court decisions were subject to appeal to Rome;
and as evident in the case of Paul and Felix and
Festus at Cæsarea, a bribe could buy freedom or
friendship. Paul could have had his liberty if he
had paid a bribe. He would not and was held
for two years. Then, while the Roman generals
cleaned out the robber bands and kidnappers of
the desert and Galilee and Dead Sea caves, they
too often, like Felix, sold both defeated brigands
and brigand prisoners as slaves for immediate
profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Roman in religion was all things to all
men. He set up the goddess Roma in the temples
with the features of whatever emperor
happened to be ruling, not because he believed
his own ruler a god, but because he saw that the
great diversity of gods in the East split the Empire
up into warring factions; and Rome aimed
to unify her Empire by religion, and doubtless
winked cynically at neglect to worship the goddess
Roma, as long as no disrespect was offered the
statue; but statue, image, picture, painting—all
were abhorrent to the Jew, who regarded all outside
the pale of the chosen people as cursed by
God; so the Jews abominated the conqueror
Romans; and the Romans despised the Jews as
bigots, fanatics, stiff-necked factionists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What added gall to bitterness with the Jews
was that, from the time of the captivity in Babylon
and Persia, from five to seven centuries before
Christ, they had not known a national, safe, stable
government of their own. There were more Jews
in Egypt and Asia Minor than in Palestine. Faction
had followed faction; revolution had followed
revolution till the Chosen People were the prey
to any conqueror from Egypt to Persia; and so
there grew up the hope of a Redeemer, a Messiah,
a royal son of the line of David, to throw off the
conqueror’s yoke and lead them to victory. Such
a Messiah, the prophets and the scrolls of the
prophets foretold. A Sadducee might be a bigoted
sceptical materialist, but when he heard the scrolls
of the seers of 500 to 700 B.C. read, predicting
exactly what had happened to Babylonia and
Assyria and Persia and Greece, the agnostic Sadducee
was not prepared to deny there might be a
Messiah. Somehow, in the modern mind, the
Pharisee is held in lower esteem than the Sadducee.
The Pharisee was a gentle and, it might be,
attudinizing self-conscious poseur; but he was a
scholar, and he was liberal, and he was a gentleman.
The Sadducee was a hard, ignorant, materialistic
bigot. He swore by Moses, but denied a
future life and set himself to grasp all the good
things of this life within reach, and had at the time
of Christ’s death captured the best sinecures
among the offices of the high priests and council of
seventy. He hated the Roman with a bigoted, materialistic
hatred, though he played politics with
him for his own job. The disappointment of both
Sadducees and Pharisees at a poor Nazarene
named Jesus, calling himself the Messiah and gaining
an enormous following, flamed into delirious
fanatic frenzy; and just then rose the Zealots and
Sicarii (short sword fighters) shouting “freedom
at any cost” and rallying all Jews in the Passover
of spring—when more than two million pilgrims
visited the Holy City—to rise and throw off the
Roman yoke. The city gates were shut. The
citizens inside had no choice but to join the rebels,
or let themselves down by ropes from the walls
at night and flee for the desert; but many citizens,
knowing the power of Rome and having all their
means invested in Jerusalem, tried to compromise.
They were plundered, tortured, murdered.
Women and children were held for ransom, or
hostages for the loyalty of the waverers; and
the rebellion that had flamed up in the name of
“freedom” presently ran lawless riot under an
ægis better named “folly”; and for seven months
the Holy City was ruled by brute-beast crime and
anarchy. If the Sadducees and the Pharisees had
intrigued with the rebellion at first, they were now
trapped in their own intrigue, for they saw their
temple chests rifled of the revenues of almost a
century, the gold sheathing ripped from the great
pillars and colonnades, the holy wine brought
from vault and cellar and poured out, mingled
with human blood, in a deluge of frenzied debauch
that lasted from spring till autumn—seven long
months. Famine only rendered the conditions
more desperate. If the Zealots surrendered now,
they knew they would be put to the sword and
lose the loot hidden in the secret aqueduct under
the Temple; so they fought with the maniacal
frenzy of cornered beasts. The Pharisees and
Sadducees of the Sanhedrim would now have
surrendered to Rome; but the Zealots pursued
them into the Holy of Holies and either stabbed
them there and threw their bodies in the aqueduct
below, or pursued them into the very aqueduct,
where they were slain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keep in mind the configuration of the Holy
City at this time—the Herod Palaces to the west,
the great Temple to the east, the whole city like
an eagle’s nest on the flat top of a lofty rock.
Between the Temple and the Palaces lay the
main body of the cramped, crowded city thoroughfares.
This central city lay in a slight depression.
Between the Temple east and the Palaces
west ran an overhead bridge. Below ran a
very large underground aqueduct, which supplied
water to the Temple. The water supplies came
from pools and cisterns used at the Palaces and
were sluiced on during the great yearly sacrifices
through the aqueduct to run under the Temple
and carry off the refuse to the precipice to the
east or south of the Temple. When the sacrifices
were over, the water was turned off the aqueduct
and presumably used for the Royal Palace enclosures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best description of ancient Jerusalem is in
Josephus covering hundreds of pages; of modern
Jerusalem is in Thomson’s <span class='it'>Land and Book</span>; but
until the transfer of control of the Holy City
from Turkish power, it has been impossible to
examine the underground passages beneath the
city of which there are many, or the lines of the
old Herod walls. Within fifty years of Christ’s
death, the site of the Temple was plowed and a
shrine set up to a pagan Venus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whichever way the war befell, the Herod
regime was doomed. By rebellion, the Jews had
forfeited their privileges. There could be no
royal revenues for the Herods through local governments.
If the Zealots had triumphed, then
Roman protection would no longer hold the
Herod throne secure; and the Herods were hated
by the populace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to the final truce portrayed in the story of
the fall of the Holy City, Titus, the commanding
Roman general, had exercised great clemency and
forbearance. He had permitted refugees from
the beleaguered city to pass through his lines
untouched, to the desert beyond Jordan. He had
sent emissary after emissary to the more intelligent
section of rulers to advise them to save themselves
by surrender; but each peace mission had
met with treachery and insult. Twice in sorties
of semipeace messengers, Titus had been cut off
from his own soldiers and almost slain; so it was
necessary to call to the aid of the regular Roman
Army, the Macedonian Mercenaries; and from
that moment, Jerusalem was doomed, for the
Mercenaries were paid in plunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Titus was at this time not yet Emperor; but
among the Jewish writers, all rulers from
Rome are referred to as Cæsar, or Emperor, or
King. The Herods were really only deputies;
but they were always called Kings. Titus was still
a very young man and his leading general, Trajan,
could not have been very much past his early
twenties. In the most scandal-loving age Rome
ever knew, very little has come down in history
against Vespasian and his son Titus. Both men
were essentially soldiers and cared little for the
empty noise of triumph and kingship, though
to keep the populace loyal Titus erected the
Great Arch, under which more than 30,000 Jewish
captives passed and on one side of which the
Jewish Tables of the Law were represented.
Vespasian and Titus built the Temple of Peace
to celebrate the victory; but if you read Josephus
carefully, it will be found this was more in concession
to mob politics than to glory in triumph.
It was to impress the seething East with fear of
Rome’s power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attempt of the Nazarenes and the scribes
to save the sacred scrolls is history, not fiction.
Many old Hebrew scrolls mentioned in the Old
Testament were lost forever at this time. There
were the <span class='it'>Book of the Covenant</span>, the <span class='it'>Book of the
Law</span>, the <span class='it'>Book of the Wars</span>, <span class='it'>Acts of David</span>,
<span class='it'>Samuel the Seer</span>, the <span class='it'>Book of Gad</span>, David’s <span class='it'>Seer</span>—and
seven other volumes not embodied by Ezra
in Scripture, but known to the Jews. Among the
lost scrolls there is a story told of the <span class='it'>Book of
Jasher</span> of which an 1840 translation lies before
me. This book is mentioned in the David wars,
and several forgeries of <span class='it'>Jasher</span> appeared. It is
said the genuine <span class='it'>Jasher</span> was brought from Jerusalem
by Titus. When his officers went to plunder
the city, one <span class='it'>Sidrus</span> found in a secret wall
chamber in an ancient scribe’s house, a library
of books among which sat the old scribe reading.
Somehow, <span class='it'>Jasher</span> was carried by the Army officers
to Seville and in 1613 it was printed in Venice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That many old scrolls were carried to Spain
either by the dispersed Jews, or by the Roman
Army, there is no doubt; for after the expulsion
of the Moors from Granada centuries later,
thousands of such Hebrew volumes were burned
in mistake for pagan Arabic. Intolerance and
fanatic ignorance are dangerous weapons, whether
ancient or modern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the interpretation given to the Zodiac
and to the prophecies by the Nazarenes in the
Herod Tower the night of the fall of the Holy
City—this is fiction; and had to be, for Gnostics,
Essenes, Nazarenes, Sadducees, Pharisees, Theosophists,
Ethiopian, Egyptian and Hindoo scholars
all disagreed violently on what the signs of the
Zodiac portended, or how the events proclaimed
by the seers of old should be fulfilled. There
isn’t any doubt at all that the prophecy of Jeremiah
was being fulfilled literally before the very
eyes of the watchers in the Herod Towers; but
when you come to the winged chariots with wheels
in Ezekiel—where the Eastern mystic would see
the wheels as symbols of planetary chains, the
western literalist would see a modern aeroplane
coursing the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one thing Eastern mystics and Western
literalists would agree—the fall of Jerusalem
marked the crash of the Old and the birth of the
New. One Order had died. A New Order was
born; and the old seeress voiced the expectation
which is so rife even to-day that the sword will
yet give place to the plowshare; that humanity
shall pass to and is working towards a more spiritual
sphere, where we may have what the scientists
call a sixth cosmic sense and command the powers
of water and air. Wireless waves give us the
first inkling of this power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The statement that “Israel burnt her children
on the walls” to the Fire God is not fiction. It is
true. It is to be found in the Bible; and within
the last ten years jars have been dug up in Palestine
where the bodies of cremated infants were
so offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Space does not permit going into the mystic sign
of a virgin in the Zodiac. We have only to
remember the Zodiac came from the Far East;
and so did the Persian magi to Christ’s manger.
Another point worth noting; the Apostles, now
grown aged, knew the Messiah’s kingdom was
not to be an earthly kingship. They learned this
very slowly, but the fall of the Holy City must
have clenched forever the convictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another very interesting point here,
which will be discussed more fully in the last
chapter. The cry of the maniac on the walls is
not fiction. It is fact. It will be found in
Josephus. It is almost the very wording of the
cries of despair in John’s <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>. In John’s
Vision are two references to the Temple as still
standing; and this brings up the question, was
the <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span> written long before John’s death
and not somewhere round 90 A.D.?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please note—there were bad earth tremors all
over the world from 66 to 68, 69, 70 and 79,
from Vesuvius to the Dead Sea. It was the last
great eruption that took the lives of the three
Herod descendants on Naples Bay; just as it was
doubtless one of the earlier tremors that threw
the great Temple door to the east open during
the siege. This door was opened only once a
year at the Passover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a record that though Matthew
passed through Cæsarea, where Philip’s prophet
daughters dwelt, and through Jerusalem on to
Egypt, a copy of his Gospel in Hebrew was first
found in Cæsarea. This is discussed fully in
the volumes already named on the apostolic days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was “the son of one Lazarus of Bethany,” the
son of Christ’s friend? The dates would seem
to prove the possibility. On the other hand,
though Bethany was a very small village, the
name Lazarus was a very common one. The
story of this escape from the city is found in
Josephus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Herodias’ husband had been banished
from Palestine to the Danube and from the
Danube to Spain will be found in the <span class='it'>Herod
Letters</span> already quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The location of the Antonia Tower was exactly
as given in the story—a bastioned high Tower
ascended by circular steps inside, with the east
wall joining the roof and upper galleries of the
Temple, the west side of the Tower running along
the parapet of the North Jerusalem Wall to the
Herod Towers of the Palaces on the west side of
the city.</p>

<div><h1 id='p_264'>APPENDIX D<br/> <br/> THE DISPUTES AS TO THECLA IN<br/> LEGEND AND HISTORY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the story of Paul and
Thecla, there are fortunately very few
controversial questions that cannot be
answered definitely and simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was there ever any real Thecla?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If so, how much of her story is legend, and
how much history?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of the known history, how closely have
the facts been followed in the story?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the Paul and Thecla legends must be
ascribed to folklore of the Roman Road, much
of it wildly exaggerated; but beneath the legends
is the fact of some young woman martyr converted
by him in Iconium, Derbe or Lystra,
escaping the ordeal of wild beasts and fire,
whether in Antioch or Iconium, and leaving a
tradition of having retired to the caves, where
she established one of the first monastic houses
among the Greeks, and drew away the Daphne
dancing girls from sensual pagan rites of the
Temples to such an extent that the merchants of
Antioch were so maddened at the fall off in
trade of sacrificial beasts, images and incense to
pleasure seekers and winterers from Rome that
they plotted against the lives of the Christian
refugees hiding in the mountain caves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much of her story is legend, and how
much history?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tertullian says her story, as given in the <span class='it'>Apocryphal</span>
New Testament, was forged by a writer of
Asia. Yet Eusebius, Gregory and a dozen others
before the fourth century refer to Thecla as
having been a genuine character, whom legend
had obscured and magnified as mist hides and
exaggerates real figures in real life. Basil of
Seleucia wrote her life in verse. Another Scholastic
reports how an emperor had visions of her.
The original version of her life on which this
story is written is now in a Greek manuscript in
the Bodleian Library and was regarded by Middle
Age biblical students as largely legendary, but a
picture of the status of woman in the first century
in Greek Asia. The references to the names of
Paul’s associates and the apostates from the faith
are the same as in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, but whether Thecla
is to be regarded as “the half wit,” who followed
Paul, or one of “the honorable women” won to
the faith, it is impossible to tell. It is disappointing
here to have to record that while the Catholic,
Armenian and secular writers acknowledge Thecla
as a fact, the great Presbyterian divines nearly all
ignore her, though they quote in full the descriptions
of Paul, from the life of Thecla. This
strikes me as not exactly according to the rules
of good sport. If the Thecla account of Paul
is true, why isn’t the account of Thecla true? It
is interesting to add there is a biblical manuscript
in the British Museum, presented to Charles I,
1628, said to have been copied by Thecla, the
Martyr. It includes the Epistles of St. Clement.
The Vatican “Aid to Bible Students” wisely
rejects the fables of Thecla’s Life; but all scholars
accept the fact there was a Thecla, Martyr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Iconium itself, or Konieh of to-day, was a city
of 30,000 people, noted for its wool and leather,
carpet and tent industries. It was a sort of halfway
house for the Greeks from the Isles of the
Sea and the desert travelers of Persia and Babylonia.
The church where Paul preached at
Iconium has been found by modern archæologists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What do modern scholars such as Ramsay and
Turner say of Thecla?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote from Turner’s review of Ramsay’s
<span class='it'>Church in the Roman Empire before A.D. 170</span>:
“The Acts of Paul and Thecla do not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. come
to us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the best of company .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and contain
all the marks which characterize this whole
class of forgeries.” He then refers to mistakes
in the place names of the Bodleian copy and the
belittling of marriage which betrays the author
of this manuscript as a Gnostic or Essene; “and
yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the details have probability .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
it is doubtful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how far it is possible to disentangle
the original matter from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. recasts.”
It was on Paul’s first missionary journey (Acts
XIII, 51). He was following the Roman Road
of Augustus and branched to Iconium. He is
described as “small, bald and bow-legged, with
close-meeting eyebrows and long nose, but
graceful, gracious and radiant.” Ramsay accepts
this description of Paul in the Thecla legends. At
Iconium, his host was the Onesiphorus, mentioned
in his letters, and he was pestered by the frantic
jealousy of the Demas and Hermogenes, also
mentioned in his letters. Paul was accused of
causing friction between man and woman; and
he was scourged and expelled from the city.
There follows the story much as I have given it
here, with long details and repetitions and embellishments
left out. When Nero used the
bodies of Christians as torches for his pleasure
gardens and a Herod daughter had to flee from
an old satyr, whom her dowry had bought—it is
a pretty sound inference without any legendary
exaggeration that a young girl, who joined the
despised Christians and refused to marry her
lover, would be treated without mercy in an age
so sensual that sex had become an untellable part
of religious worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we come to one of the proofs that
Thecla was more than legend. The <span class='it'>grande dame</span>
who adopted her is variously named Trifina, Trefina,
Tryphæna of the house of Polemon (date
of reign 37 B.C. to 63 A.D.). It was to one
of the Kings of the house that Bernice was the
second time married and from whom she fled to
Jerusalem. He was a converted pagan to the
Jewish faith, probably to get Bernice’s dowry.
The Herod daughters were half Arab, but they
were also half of the Jewish high-priest blood;
and union with what one historian calls “these
half-breed brutes” proved too strong for even
Herod blood. Trefina was daughter of a Polemon
from 44 A.D. to 63 A.D. This Polemon’s
wife had been a first cousin to the Emperor
Claudius and ruled over Pontus jointly with her
son till about 40 A.D., when she retired. Her
daughter had died, and the query is—was her son
the man who married Bernice; or had Trefina’s
husband discarded her and married Bernice? Her
son was reigning at the time she passed through
Iconium. Her dead daughter’s name is given as
Falconilla, the same as in the legend of Thecla.
To know the type of the vice of this house one
must read Apollonius’ <span class='it'>Life</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Practically the verdict of Ramsay and Turner
on Thecla is, “the <span class='it'>Acts of Thecla</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. expand
the hints of St. Luke and throw a welcome light
on the social conditions.” Luke refers to “many
women” attending Paul’s services in the house of
Onesiphorus. In other words, Thecla was a
personality, but her real history is lost in legend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the legend, how closely have the facts been
followed in this story? Modern decency would
not permit all the details of the insults to Thecla,
so these are shortened in the story here. She was
exposed not only in the arena of Iconium but in
the arena of Antioch for repulsing the lewd advances
of the city magistrate, who in one of the
fêtes represented the god Roma and proceeded
to claim her as a vestal virgin. All these details
have been omitted or shortened in the story, and
her experiences have been centered at Iconium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, the story conforms to the facts of
the age. The Greeks were the rich trader class
despised by the soldierly Romans. Men were
addicted to effeminacy, jealousy, self-adornment;
and the Greek matrons chased their daughters
into early marriages to avoid having evidence of
age in their family. Paul was called a “Jewish
babbler” here as he was in Greece. Girls who
would neither marry nor become temple vestals
were thrust in the streets as courtesans. The red
cord of the courtesan marked the difference between
the temple virgins consecrated to the god
and the temple girl kept as a bait for lust and
revenue, of which one Aphrodite Temple had a
colossal revenue. Gnostics will deny that the
names of “the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost”
were used in baptism before the fourth century.
I refuse to discuss the controversy—it is nonessential
to the true picture of conditions set
forth in the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one interesting minor point for the
argumentative to worry over. Paul refers again
and again to the man with shaved hair, the woman
with unshaved and covered head, both references
really advising the Christian away from the
temple vices which becurled men and women with
short red-corded hair symbolized. There is a
reference to Paul taking a vow, himself, that
carried him to Jerusalem. (Acts xviii, 18).
He had his head shaved. Now, the Thecla legend
describes Paul as “bald,” like a man who, Roman
fashion, had always worn his hair short. Yet the
most of the pictures of Paul and the other early
saints represent them with hair like a thatch,
beards like Druids, and expressions about as
cheerful as an inverted tablespoon, though their
evangel was called “the Glad News,” and the
keynote of Paul’s life was—“Rejoice.”</p>

<div><h1 id='p_271'>APPENDIX E<br/> <br/> CONCERNING THE EARLY GNOSTICS AND<br/> APOLLOS AND APOLLONIUS AND JOHN</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>With the bitter and raging disputes, regarding
the writing of the <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>;
whether John followed the Gnostics or
the Gnostics followed John; whether John was the
son of Zebedee, whose mother once pleaded that
he might sit at the right hand of Christ throned
in his earthly kingdom, or whether this John was
a younger man; whether the Gospel was written
before or after the <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>; whether the
“Beast” symbolized a dragon of approaching
universal anarchy, or Rome’s brute power, or the
goddess Roma in the Temple; whether Onesimus,
the runaway slave, was Onesimus, the young
bishop of Ephesus; whether the passing of
Apollos is legend or fact; why a man like Apollos,
of whom the contemporary literature of the day
is full of references, was so completely ignored
by all the early writers of the church except three
or four, the last story of this volume as fiction
has nothing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object has been to shun controversy as a
smoke screen concealing facts under prejudice
and ignorance, and use the story only to throw a
flashlight on early conditions; but for students,
who wish to come to their own conclusions and
not have other people’s conclusions rammed down
their throats, a few references will be given,
which can be followed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, it was self-evident to all the Christian
communities by the last quarter of the first century
A.D.—in which the story is timed—that
Christ had not come to set up a glorified earth
kingship. Rather, he had come to transmute the
earth kingdom into a régime so in harmony with
His own Unseen Kingdom that it would transmute
the world into a New Heaven and a New
Earth. This was the Christian’s job, first in
getting himself cleansed of sin, second in working
for humanity, and it was now apparent it was a
long job stretching down the centuries; so the
writings of John, instead of being “close ups”
as the movies would put it, are telescopic flashes
back to the night of time and creation and telescopic
flashes forward to the eternity of soul and
universe; and the pivot of the telescope is the
little flash between past and future called “now”;
and the eye looking through the telescope to past
and future is John’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here are a few historic facts as guide posts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fall of Jerusalem had driven the Christians
from Antioch to Ephesus, for reasons already
given—Antioch was overrun with the Army.
While Ephesus was not a great commercial center
like Corinth, it was the third city of the
civilized world as a center of learning, worship,
culture, wealth. Rome ranked first. Athens came
next, Ephesus and Alexandria next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the time the goddess Roma was set up,
the temples began to be deserted; and this infuriated
Rome, who hoped to see the new deity unify
her crumbling empire in a new cohesion. The
Nero persecutions of 64 to 68, which had been
the diversion of a cruel madman, now became the
set policy of the Empire under Domitian, and
ran a terrible course from 81 to 96 A.D. The
Christians were dispersed, but they were not immune.
Again and again we find that Demetrius,
the silversmith, who gave Paul such trouble as
related in the <span class='it'>Acts</span>, called to confer in Rome as
to the restoration of the old religions. See the
<span class='it'>Life of Apollonius</span>. The falling away from the
temples not only alarmed the Empire, but dislocated
trade. It hurt the silversmith’s trade
from Ephesus to Damascus and cut off an enormous
yearly market for the cattle and sheep of
sacrifice. The pocket nerve was touched; and the
cruelty of an acute anger was mingled with the
most diabolical obscene falsehoods to destroy the
new Christian cult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing disloyal could be proved against John;
so his banishment to Patmos was revoked.
Frightful volcanic fires could be seen from Patmos
during John’s stay there, and the whole Mediterranean
rang with the horror of the Vesuvius
eruption. We may find tinges of this in his
<span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>. See Peters’ <span class='it'>Bible and Spade</span>, Beckwith’s
<span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>, Turner’s <span class='it'>Early Church History</span>,
Malden’s <span class='it'>New Testament</span>, and the other
authorities mentioned in former supplementary
chapters. Irenæus says John settled and lived
in Ephesus till the reign of Trajan. He is supposed
to have come back from Patmos to Ephesus
and helped in a training school for Christian
workers there. Ephesus was the very center of
Platonic and Gnostic learning at this time; and
the Gnostic beliefs of the “Logos” or “Word”
run all through John’s writings. There is a curious
difference in John’s attitude to Rome in the
Gospel and in the <span class='it'>Apocalypse</span>. The former seems
to counsel rendering to Cæsar the things that are
Cæsar’s; in the latter, the Seven Hilled City is
a Beast. Why? The only answer is a guess that
hardly needs to be given. The martyrdom of the
Christians had begun. Clement refers to the
recall of John from Patmos after Domitian’s
death. Nor could anything disloyal be proved
against Apollonius. Though he openly said that
he detested “tyrants,” no king need put that cap
on unless it fitted; but as he frequented the temples
and ignored the goddess Roma, he was considered
dangerous and so was tried on the charge
of having torn a boy’s entrails out for the purposes
of divination. The charge was ridiculous
and could not be proved, and Apollonius came
back to Ephesus and frequented Crete, where
Titus, the Greek and youthful Christian, had become
Christian bishop by 65 A.D. The fact
that the young Titus would work in the Christian
Church and the aged Apollonius in the pagan
temples may explain the hostility or silence of
some of the church fathers to the Eastern Sage.
This seems to me a more rational explanation
than the Theosophists’ charge that the Christians
were jealous of Apollonius as a rival in the eyes
of the populace to Christ. Apollonius is never
spoken of as “a rival to Christ.” He is spoken
of as a worker of miracles, which could not be
denied, and as a clairvoyant “see-er” of events
which came to pass, like the reign of Vespasian,
the deterioration of Domitian and the assassination
of the tyrant. If Apollos be Apollonius—and
I decline to give even an opinion on that dispute,
in spite of dates, abbreviations and events pointing
to only one “Apollos” sage in this era—Paul
settled the matter when he said one “planted”
and the other “watered” and “God gave the increase.”
The rivalry was rather between Paul
and Apollos—and it was a rivalry of fanatic
followers, not leaders. Let us not blame the followers
too harshly. Paul had made it his life
work that Christianity should not be an off-shoot
of Judaism but an all-embracing world religion.
Apollos still preached in the pagan temples and
the Christians may have feared dilutions of the
pure truths with such errors as the fleshy Nicolatians,
whom John denounced; if the flesh was only
a garment, then it didn’t matter much what sins
stained the garment—you could lay it off. Therefore
liberty ran riot in the libertine and visions
ran to medium frenzies. Some of these trance
frenzies were of such a nature as cannot be told.
In one, the initiate to the mysteries was placed
naked and drugged under a high altar, on which
was slain a bull. The aspirant to enter the mysteries
had to open his mouth and drink of the hot
blood as it poured down on him—an almost parallel
ceremony with the Ancient Aztecs, where the
blood was human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To revert to the historic facts on Ephesus—it
was a dream city of inexpressible beauty, basking
in a wonderful sunlight between mountain and sea,
with white alabaster colonnades—one hundred
and twenty columns there were across the
face of the Diana Temple, which was over four
hundred feet long and two hundred broad—at
the entrance to the Temple, to the great hippodrome
reported to seat 50,000 people, to the
public square park in the heart of the city, to the
baths, to the circus, to the fountains. The city
occupied an area of five by three miles. Coming
out of the Mediterranean, ships ascended the
dredged Cayster River, to a square basin landlocked
and surrounded by a magnificent stone
parapet. On one side were the wharfs and docks;
on the other the broad steps up to Diana’s Temple.
The city proper, with its public park, faced
the end of the basin of the sea through more magnificent
elaborate colonnades. In fact, it might
be said there was neither an ungraceful nor inartistic
architectural line in all Ephesus. The city
might have been dedicated and consecrated to
beauty. The Diana goddess was not the huntress
as told in the story. The huntress had been
degraded first into an Eastern Astarte presiding
over the productive powers of the earth, and
finally still farther degraded to the sensuous rites,
which at this time were running a sort of delirious
frenzied riot in the world. Cressets of naphtha
petroleum oils, and asbestos soap or oils may be
used to explain much of the apparent magic of
altar fires that never went out and priests who
could handle flame without harm; and all the
magic was concentrated on the materialistic aim
of obtaining revenues from the enormous traffic
that passed through Ephesus to and from Asia to
Rome; and the great Diana festivals were at
Ephesus in spring. Earthquake and war demolished
ancient Ephesus. The Diana statue was
carried off to France. The stones of the beautiful
Ionic columns went to build churches in Sienna and
Rome. The ruins of Ephesus by 1888, when the
archæologist’s spade had been busy, were a melancholy
epic in crumbling stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a century ago, the legends of underground
chambers in Crete were regarded as myths. To-day,
we know those myths were founded on historic
fact and the spade has dug up ancient Crete
culture. Phillimore ridicules Flinders Petrie for
accepting the story of the earthquake and storms
on the night of Apollonius’ passing from human
ken in the Temple at Cydonia, Crete. Yet there
is not a sailor of the Mediterranean, who does
not know the superstition of all Cretans at the
time of the spring and fall equinoctial gales. The
Island trembles and vibrates to the storms. Cretans
say to this day—and there are 300,000 of
them believe it—that Crete was created by a volcanic
blow-up—a remnant of the submerged
Atlantis—and is very delicately balanced on subterranean
rocks. When the gales come, it trembles
on this balance. Knossus marks the ruins of the
Palace of Minos of 3000 B.C. Greek hermits
still frequent the mountains of the Island and live
the tranquil life of the ancient contemplative
Gnostic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Patmos, little is to be said except that it is
not so large as the length and breadth of New
York City, and was a very short run by sail from
Ephesus, ships usually pausing to and from Crete.
In the story, Onesimus paused on his way back.
The ecstasy of the <span class='it'>Revelation</span> on Patmos would
to-day be called “a glimpse of cosmic consciousness”;
and there is no use going into the dispute
whether the vision covered only the few months
John was exile on Patmos, or a series of years
beginning at the fall of the Holy City and extending
down to the reign of Domitian, when persecution
compelled the Christians to use cypher in
many of their communications; and “the Beast”
may have been symbolized with emperor worship,
or the impending anarchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story takes for granted that Onesimus, the
runaway slave, was Onesimus, the young bishop.
This is a disputed point. I don’t care to take up
the dispute. It is nonessential to the aim of the
story; but if the question of his age be asked it is
easily answered. If Onesimus were a young man
of twenty with Paul in Rome in 64 to 68, then by
86 to 96 A.D., when John is supposed “to have
fallen asleep in Ephesus,” he would still be a
young man in his forties to preside over the destinies
of Christianity at the very pivotal point in
Grecian Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For those who like to worry disputes out as a
dog worries a cat, or a cat worries a mouse, the
references of the early fathers to Onesimus may
be quoted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Ignatius’ <span class='it'>Letters to the Ephesians</span>, which
Archbishop Usher of Oxford, 1644 (see <span class='it'>Evelyn’s
Journals</span>), issued, and later scholars regarded as
authentic letters, though corrupted in texts—when
Ignatius himself was on his way to martyrdom in
Rome, are found the words—“I received, therefore,
in the name of God, your whole multitude in
Onesimus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who, according to the flesh is
your bishop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whom I beseech you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that
you strive to be like unto him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and blessed
be God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are worthy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enjoy such an
excellent bishop.” Then he goes on to speak of
“Burrhus,” who was a handy man for Nero in the
days Onesimus was in Rome, and Paul and Luke
wrote of “friends in Cæsar’s household.” Again,
he couples the names of Onesimus and Burrhus in
the seventh verse of the first chapter. Again, he
congratulates them on their Bishop in Chapter
II, who commends their “good order” to Ignatius
on his way to Rome in bonds. In his letter
to the Magnesians he refers to Onesimus and
Apollonius as working together and begs them not
to use their “bishop too familiarly, owing to his
youth.” Though “to appearance young, he must
be obeyed, because he presides in the place of
God.” In his letter from Smyrna to the Trallians,
he refers to the faith having got inside the Palace
at Rome; and his letter to the Philadelphians is
written by “Burrhus sent from Ephesus”; and
Ignatius of Antioch, to quote Turner of Oxford,
“was a trusted and responsible leader.” The
martyrdom of Ignatius is no longer placed as late
as 107 A.D., so the discrepancy in dates here is
still unsettled. (See Bishop Lightfoot.) To show
how widely and wildly scholars vary in their dates,
take your New Testament, note the dates of the
letters at the heads of the Epistles, and compare
to these dates given in Turner—Peter visits Rome
42 A.D. (See date 60 to 66 A.D. of Peter’s
letters from Babylon.) Peter and Paul martyred
in Rome 57 or 58 A.D. (Note the dates of Paul’s
Epistles from 59 to 64 A.D.) Suicide Nero, 67
or 68 A.D. (Yet Paul’s second trial was towards
the end of Nero’s life.) Death Domitian 95 or
96. (Note date of Apollonius’ prediction in
Ephesus.) I give these wide variations in authorities
solely to show how picayune and childish and
nonessential to the picture as a whole are the
minor points over which scholars have wrangled;
while youth grew bored and slipped away from
teachers, who wrangled instead of teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these references are not proofs, but they
throw the burden of disproof on those who call
Paul’s servant a “bell hop” and declare the Onesimus
of Ephesus another Greek. Onesimus was
the carrier of Paul’s letter to the Ephesians; and
Apollos was the great Gnostic leader in Ephesus at
this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passing of Apollonius in Crete is too long
a story to be repeated here. I have followed
Flinders Petrie, though those who want to jump
into the controversy over Apollonius would do
well to read Phillimore’s acrid comments and the
Theosophists’ who are a modern and divided edition
of the ancient Gnostics. The Theosophists
say Apollonius is the riddle of riddles of the first
century. “No one knows where he came from or
where he went.” By Empire and Church, “every
means were used to sweep his memory from men’s
minds,” because he would conform to neither Empire
nor Church. Whether he died in Crete, or
Ephesus, about 96 A.D., the modern Gnostics do
not say. He remained always the aristocrat, the
scorner of all outward show of piety or power.
The churches of Asia actually prayed to Apollonius
after his death, so one sees another reason
why the church discouraged his cult, just as Paul
had to stop Asiatic Greeks from worshiping him.
He was lecturing in Ephesus at the time Domitian
was murdered in Rome—and suddenly stopped in
the middle of his lectures and described the far-off
crime in the Imperial City, crying out to the
assassins to strike home to the tyrant’s heart.
Then he described the wild joy in the Roman city
streets over the news of Domitian’s death. A
descendant of Trefina’s of the Thecla legend built
him a fane in Asia Minor. In those days, they
called it a Temple to a new god, Apollonius. In
our day, we would probably call it a memorial
church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these hints, any one feeling it a personal
mission to settle the disputes on which the flashlight
has been cast by the five stories of the apostolic
ages—can do the settling for his own conscience
and let his fellow readers do the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day has passed when youth will be bludgeoned
into belief. It wants facts, or as close as
it can get to facts—then it will do its own believing
or disbelieving; and as Malden says, Christianity
takes its stand on the ground of historic
truth. Let us get the flashlight on the essential
truths.</p>

<div><h1 id='p_283'>FINALE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>At a time when our own modern world seems
to be passing through a welter similar to
the apostolic ages, it may not be amiss to
close by quoting from Bishop Solomon at Lake
Van, Armenia, who officiated between the Tigris
and Euphrates about 1222 A.D. His <span class='it'>Book of the
Bee</span>, translated by Wallis Budge, the great orientalist,
in 1886 (Oxford), reflects many of the
ancient church traditions among the religious communities
founded by the Apostles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old scholar gives his work the name of
<span class='it'>the Bee</span> because the bee culls its pure honey from
all flowers; and so he attempts to cull the best
from the old records of the early church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He begins with the creation as told in Genesis
and interprets that record partly as a mystic race
record according to the Gnostics and Theosophists,
and partly as a record of fact; but he sets
down both interpretations side by side, and forces
no conclusions. You get the sense that the old
scholar knows he is dealing with an epic; but
whether that epic is a myth reflecting a fact on the
clouds, or a fact obscured by myth—you must decide
for yourself; for “Know, O brother,” he says,
“where there is true love, there is no fear; and
where there is freedom of speech, there is no
dread .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on subjects beyond the capacity of
our simple understanding .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do not enquire too
closely into the divine words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the advice is as good for our day as for
his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thirty chapters have an amazing similarity
to <span class='it'>Genesis</span>, the <span class='it'>Book of Enoch</span>, the <span class='it'>Book of
Jasher</span>, <span class='it'>Revelation</span>; and should be read parallel
with <span class='it'>Ezekiel</span> and <span class='it'>Daniel</span>. They carry the human
mind back to the very dawn of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is where the record comes down to apostolic
days that it throws a flashlight on the historic
personages in the fiction of this volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I make no comment but set down in brief the
old writer’s contributions to historic data.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He says that Mary, the Mother of the Messiah,
was brought up among the Temple virgins. The
Salome, who was the midwife at Christ’s birth, resembles
the Salome of the Gnostics’ <span class='it'>Pistis Sophia</span>.
Whether the star followed by the Magi were a
star of vision, or a constellation of the Zodiac—he
does not know. He does not think the massacre
of the infants followed immediately after the
visit to the manger, but within two years. The
legends of the Magi’s gifts are given very fully.
He says it was the father of Nathaniel who saved
John the Baptist’s life, when Zechariah was murdered
before the altar of the Temple. This refers
to Christ’s recognition of Nathaniel later
with Philip. He says Christ met Lazarus first in
Egypt, when Lazarus befriended the exiles,
Joseph and Mary. The Herodias episode is given
very fully as recorded in Chapter II here.
Machærus is given as the place of John’s imprisonment
and murder. Abgar, King of Edessa, who
wrote letters to Christ, finally bought Christ’s
woven seamless garment over which the soldiers
cast dice. Joseph of Arimathea, he calls a Senator.
He says Mary died between her fifty-eighth
and sixty-first year. He gives very fully the ten
occasions on which Christ was seen in vision or in
body—the last time by Stephen and Paul. The
upper chamber of the Last Supper had been prepared
by Lazarus to whom it belonged, by Simon
the Cyrenian, who helped to carry the cross, by
Joseph, the Senator, and by Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His notes on the Apostles are invaluable. Peter
preached in Antioch and in Rome, where Nero
crucified him, head downwards. Andrew, his
brother, went to the wild Scythians of the North.
John, the son of Zebedee, the hero of the fifth
story in this volume—over whom the higher
critics have waged such bootless battle—preached
in Ephesus, was exiled to Patmos, came back to
Ephesus, built a church and taught there with
Ignatius, till he “fell asleep.” John Second, a
young disciple of John the Apostle, became Bishop
of Ephesus and wrote the <span class='it'>Revelation</span> as told him
word for word by John, the friend of Christ.
This brings up a dispute hoary with age. Was the
youth beloved of Christ, the first John or the second?
I cannot answer that question. The dispute
as to the death of James is unconsciously explained
by the author of the <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span>. James was
cast down from a pinnacle of the Temple. The
rabble that pursued, slew him with sword and
stone. He was slain by order of Herod, Bernice’s
first husband. Philip left his prophetess daughters
in Cæsarea and worked in Phrygia, Onesimus’
home country. Thomas went from Jerusalem to
Persia and India, where he was stabbed to death
for baptizing the daughter of a great ruler. No
modern scholar needs to be told there are remnants
of Thomas’ early followers yet in India.
Matthew found refuge from the Jews in Tyre
and Sidon and Antioch. The <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span>
says nothing of his mission to Egypt. Bartholomew
worked in Armenia; Jude in Laodicea,
the city of wealth and apathy; Simon Zelotes, inward
from Aleppo; James, son of Alphæus, in
Tadmor—Palmyra, the glorious; Matthias, successor
to Judas, in Sicily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Rome, Paul sought the Gentiles; Peter, the
dispersed Jews. There are disputes here, I don’t
care to go into. I have already touched on them.
Peter gave his record to Mark; Paul, his to Luke—which
jibes remarkably with the verdict of
higher critics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luke had been the physician, who attended
Lazarus—a not improbable thing if Lazarus were
in Egypt as Luke’s writings are full of reference
to the Greek culture of Alexandria, Egypt. Mark
is given as a stepson of Peter; and Rhoda was his
sister. Zacchæus, the publican, was slain, while
preaching. Joseph, the Senator, transferred his
labors to the ten Greek cities of Decapolis. Nicodemus
and his brother, Gamaliel, the great philosophers,
became open professors of the faith.
Nathaniel was stoned to death. Simon, son of
Cleopas, became a bishop in Jerusalem. Cephas
(Peter) taught in Baalbec—the wonder of the
Old World; Barnabas in Italy; Titus in Crete;
Justus in Cæsarea; Hermas, the shepherd, in
Antioch; and others of the seventy dispersed to all
parts of the known world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Onesimus, the <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> says “his
legs were broken in Rome.” Whether this was
when he fled for protection to Paul—in which
case, the story is much more dramatic and illustrative
of the beauty of Paul’s character than I have
given—or after his return from distributing Paul’s
letters to the Greeks of Asia—the record does not
say. It is probably this reference that gave rise
to the young Onesimus, who became bishop, being
distinct from the young Onesimus, whom Paul
sent back to Asia Minor. The record does not
say he suffered martyrdom in Rome—simply that
“his legs were broken.” Apollos, the <span class='it'>Book of the
Bee</span> says, was “burnt with fire.” I have no comment
to make on that. If Apollos were Apollonius,
his fate could be ascribed to death by fire;
but if Apollos were not Apollonius, then the lack
of all reference to Apollonius, so famous from
Rome to India, by a writer of the legends of the
apostolic days, is very remarkable; for Apollonius
had a temple named after him in Asia Minor and
had been a great figure in his day in Babylonia.
Timothy taught and died in Ephesus. Candace’s
Eunuch established missions in Ethiopia. The
foster brother of Herod is called Manæl, not
Manæn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The names of those followers, who fell away in
persecution, are much as given in Paul’s letters
and early church history—Judas, Simon, Levi,
Hymenæus, Demas—of the riots in Asia Minor.
The <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> says Philip had three daughters,
who were see-ers, or prophetesses; <span class='it'>the Acts</span>
say four. The <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> says each of the
Twelve and of the Seventy jotted down memories
of Christ, but to avoid confusion, confided their
memories—the Twelve to Matthew and John;
the Seventy to Luke and Mark—and this, too,
sustains the shots in the dark of the higher
critics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child, of whom Christ said, “except ye become
as children,” the <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> says, grew
up to be Ignatius. The children on whom Christ
laid his hands were Timothy and Titus. The
Marys of the Gospel were—Mary, the Mother
of the Messiah; Mary, the mother of Cleopas;
Mary, the wife of Peter and mother of Mark;
Mary, the sister of Lazarus. Was Mary, the
sinner, the Mary of Magdala out of whom were
cast the demons? The <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> says
frankly the early church did not know. They
know she was healed and became a holy woman.
Thecla, the <span class='it'>Book of the Bee</span> refers to as “the
Blessed”; so that I cannot regard the legend as a
fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot close better than to quote the prophecies
of the old sage of 1200 A.D. Keep in mind
exactly what has happened in Asia Minor between
1914 and 1924, and then decide for yourself
whether all see-ers are “self-hypnotized fakirs,”
or “deluded epileptics having fits”—which I have
heard them called by teachers of youth. At all
events, give this old seer the same fair hearing you
do to the prophecies of Roger Bacon, the friar,
who was almost contemporary, imprisoned in another
part of the world for predicting what science
would accomplish; and when you have done that
fairly and squarely, lay the book down and ask
yourself what you believe. As the prophecies
cover nearly twenty pages, I condense: “the children
of Ishmael will go forth from this wilderness
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the fat ones of the kingdom of the
Greeks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be destroyed by Ishmael, the
wild ass of the desert .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it shall be a merciless
chastisement .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the sin of the Christians
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mad with drunkenness, anger, shameless
lasciviousness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hence God will deliver them
over to the impurity of the Barbarians.” There
follows just what happened in the late War, the
murder of men, the pollution of women, the death
of the children, the robbery of all property, the
sale into slavery of harem and desert bandit, the
oppression of the poor. “They will mock at those
who frame laws. The little shall be esteemed as
the great, the despised as the honorable, from sea
to sea, from east to west, from north to
south .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hungering and thirsting and torture in
bonds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. infants torn from their mothers’
bosoms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. priests and deacons slain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
clothes for their horses out of holy vestments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
cattle in the churches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. famine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead
bodies without any to bury them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while the
tyrants shall boast—‘the Christians have neither
a God, nor a deliverer.’ ” There follows the victory
of the Greeks and a terrible slaughter.
“Egypt ravaged, Arabia burnt, Hebron laid
waste.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then shall follow “a great peace
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. joy on earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. churches reopened .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
great cities rebuilt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the gates of the
North” shall be opened. Twenty-two kingdoms
shall come through the gates of the North. In the
plains of Joppa, the great battle will be fought.
The leader of destruction will fight there and be
overthrown by a leader of the cross from the land
of Ethiopia. The leader of destruction will delude
many with “phantoms.” Hosts of the Indians
will ally themselves with him. Then will come a
second Elijah (or Elias) and lead to the great
victory of the cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There follows the passing of the Old Order
like a garment discarded for the New when a
light shall burst over humanity with the effulgent
radiance of the very heavens; when those, who
are asleep shall awake clothed in light, eternally
young; when each shall treasure his eternal light
and fire in his own spirit; when the only grief shall
be the grief for transgression of laws man can
never break, but which break man; when the love
of God shall extend to the meanest and poorest
of all creatures; when justice will exact “to the
uttermost farthing” of repentance for sin; when
those barred from light will be those only who
persist in barring light from their spirit.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Here, let us close the old seer’s prophecy, be it
trance or dream; for his hope is the hope of all
humanity with all its creeds for all time, now
as then.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
